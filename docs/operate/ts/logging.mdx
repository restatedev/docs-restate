The TypeScript SDK includes an internal logger to help you monitor and debug your services.

## Log Levels

You can control the verbosity of logs using environment variables:

- **Set the log level:**  
  Use the `RESTATE_LOGGING` environment variable.  
  Possible values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`.

- **Default log level:**  
  - `INFO` if `NODE_ENV=production`  
  - `DEBUG` otherwise

- **Verbose journal logging:**  
  If you set `RESTATE_LOGGING=TRACE`, you can enable even more detailed journal logs with:  
  `RESTATE_JOURNAL_LOGGING=TRACE`

## Console Logging

By default, using the Node.js console logger will print log statements repeatedly during replays.  
**To avoid duplicate logs during replays, use the Restate context logger.**

The context logger wraps the console and suppresses duplicate log statements during replays:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/logging.ts"} 
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const service = restate.object({
  name: "Greeter",
  handlers: {
    greet: async (ctx: restate.ObjectContext, name: string) => {
      ctx.console.info("This will not be printed again during replays");
      ctx.console.debug("This will not be printed again during replays");
      // Any other console logging method can be used
    },
  },
});
```

- The context logger uses the same log level filtering as described above.
- Use `ctx.console` for all logging inside handlers to ensure clean, non-redundant logs.
