AI agents are long-running processes that combine LLMs with tools and external APIs to complete complex tasks. With Restate, you can build agents that are **resilient to failures**, **stateful across conversations**, and **observable** without managing complex retry logic or external state stores.

In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Build durable AI agents that recover automatically from crashes and API failures
- Integrate Restate with the OpenAI Agent SDK for Python
- Observe and debug agent executions with detailed traces
- Implement resilient human-in-the-loop workflows with approvals and timeouts
- Manage conversation history and state across multi-turn interactions
- Orchestrate multiple agents working together on complex tasks

## Getting Started

A Restate AI application has two main components:
- **Restate Server**: The core engine that takes care of the orchestration and resiliency of your agents
- **Agent Services**: Your agent or AI workflow logic using the Restate SDK for durability

<img src="/img/tour/agents/ai-app-layout.png" alt="Application Structure"/>

Restate works with how you already deploy your agents, whether that's in Docker, on Kubernetes, or via serverless platforms (Modal, AWS Lambda...). You don't need to run your agents in any special way.

Let's run an example locally to get a better feel for how it works.

### Run the agent
[Install Restate](/installation) and launch it:
```bash
restate-server
```

Get the example:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:restatedev/ai-examples.git
cd ai-examples/openai-agents/tour-of-agents
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/main/openai-agents/tour-of-agents" />

Export your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and run the agent:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
uv run . 
```

Then, tell Restate where your agent is running via the UI (`http://localhost:9070`) or CLI:
```bash
restate deployments register http://localhost:9080
```

This registers a set of agents that we will be covering in this tutorial.

To test your setup, invoke the weather agent, either via the UI playground by clicking on the `run` handler of the `WeatherAgent` in the overview:

<Frame>
<img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/playground.png" alt="Playground" />
</Frame>

Or via `curl`:
```bash
curl localhost:8080/WeatherAgent/run \
  --json '{"message": "What is the weather like in San Francisco?"}'
```

You should see the weather information printed in the terminal.

Let's have a look at what happened under the hood to make your agents resilient.

## Durable Execution

AI agents make multiple LLM calls and tool executions that can fail due to rate limits, network issues, or service outages.
Restate uses Durable Execution to make your agents withstand failures without losing progress.

The Restate SDK records the steps the agent executes in a log and replays them if the process crashes or is restarted:
<img src="/img/tour/agents/durable-execution-animation-agents.gif" alt="Durable AI Agent Execution" />

Durable Execution is the basis of how Restate makes your agents resilient to failures.
Restate offers durable execution primitives via its SDK.

## Creating a Durable Agent

To implement a durable agent, you can use the Restate SDK in combination with the OpenAI Agent SDK.

Here's the implementation of the durable weather agent you just invoked:

```python durable_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/durable_agent.py?collapse_imports"} 
@function_tool(failure_error_function=raise_restate_errors)
async def get_weather(
    wrapper: RunContextWrapper[restate.Context], req: WeatherRequest
) -> WeatherResponse:
    """Get the current weather for a given city."""
    # Do durable steps using the Restate context
    restate_context = wrapper.context
    return await restate_context.run_typed("Get weather", fetch_weather, city=req.city)


weather_agent = Agent[restate.Context](
    name="WeatherAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent that provides weather updates.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)


agent_service = restate.Service("WeatherAgent")


@agent_service.handler()
async def run(restate_context: restate.Context, prompt: WeatherPrompt) -> str:

    result = await Runner.run(
        weather_agent,
        input=prompt.message,
        # Pass the Restate context to tools to make tool execution steps durable
        context=restate_context,
        # Choose any model and let Restate persist your calls
        run_config=RunConfig(
            model="gpt-4o",
            model_provider=DurableModelCalls(restate_context),
            model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False),
        ),
    )

    return result.final_output
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/durable_agent.py" />

First, you implement your agent and its tools, similar to how you would do it with the OpenAI Agent SDK.

To serve the agent over HTTP with Restate, you create a Restate Service and define handlers.
Here, the agent logic is called from the `run` handler.
The endpoint that serves the agents of this tour over HTTP is defined in [`__main__.py`](https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/__main__.py).
The agent can now be called at `http://localhost:8080/WeatherAgent/run`.

The main difference compared to a standard OpenAI agent is the use of the Restate Context at key points throughout the agent logic.
Any action with the Context is automatically recorded by the Restate Server and survives failures.
We use this for:
1. **Persisting LLM responses**: We use the `DurableModelCalls(restate_context)` model provider in `Runner.run`, so that every LLM response is saved in Restate Server and can be replayed during recovery.
2. **Resilient tool execution**: Tools can make steps durable by using Context actions. Their outcome will then be persisted for recovery and retried until they succeed. `restate_context.run_typed` runs an action durably, retrying it until it succeeds and persisting the result in Restate (e.g. database interaction, API calls, non-deterministic actions).

<Accordion title ="Propagating Restate Context to tools">
The Restate Context gets supplied to the `run` handler by the Restate SDK when the handler is invoked.
This context is then propagated to tools via the agent context.
The Restate Context can also be contained in an object together with additional context.
Learn more from [the OpenAI docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/context/).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"Try out Durable Execution"} icon={"laptop"}>
Ask for the weather in Denver:
```bash
curl localhost:8080/WeatherAgent/run \
--json '{"message": "What is the weather like in Denver?"}'
```

On the invocation page in the UI, click on the invocation ID of the failing invocation.
You can see that your request is retrying because the weather API is down:

<Frame>
<img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/weather-agent-stuck.png" alt="Invocation overview" />
</Frame>

To fix the problem, remove the line `fail_on_denver` from the `fetch_weather` function in the `app/utils/utils.py` file:

```python utils/utils.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/utils/utils.py#weather"} 
async def fetch_weather(city: str) -> WeatherResponse:
    fail_on_denver(city)
    weather_data = await call_weather_api(city)
    return parse_weather_data(weather_data)
```

Once you restart the service, the workflow finishes successfully.

</Accordion>

## Observing your Agent

As you saw in the previous section, the Restate UI comes in handy when monitoring and debugging your agents.

The Invocations tab shows all agent executions with detailed traces of every LLM call, tool execution, and state change:
<Frame>
    <img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/weather-agent.png" alt="Invocation overview" />
</Frame>

<Accordion title={"OpenTelemetry Integration"}>
    Restate supports OpenTelemetry for exporting traces to external systems like Langfuse, DataDog, or Jaeger:

    Have a look at the [tracing docs](/server/monitoring/tracing) to set this up.
</Accordion>

Now that you know how to build and debug an agent, let's look at more advanced patterns.

## Human-in-the-Loop Agent

Many AI agents need human oversight for high-risk decisions or gathering additional input. Restate makes it easy to pause agent execution and wait for human input.

**Benefits with Restate:**
- If the agent crashes while waiting for human input, Restate continues waiting and recovers the promise on another process.
- If the agent runs on function-as-a-service platforms, the Restate SDK lets the function suspend while its waiting. Once the approval comes in, the Restate Server invokes the function again and lets it resume where it left off. This way, you don't pay for idle waiting time ([Learn more](https://www.restate.dev/blog/resilient-serverless-agents#cost-efficiency-scaling-to-zero-while-waiting)).

Here's an insurance claim agent that asks for human approval for high-value claims:

```python human_approval_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/human_approval_agent.py#here"} 
@function_tool(failure_error_function=raise_restate_errors)
async def human_approval(
    wrapper: RunContextWrapper[restate.Context], claim: InsuranceClaim
) -> str:
    """Ask for human approval for high-value claims."""
    restate_context = wrapper.context

    # Create an awakeable for human approval
    approval_id, approval_promise = restate_context.awakeable(type_hint=str)

    # Request human review
    await restate_context.run_typed(
        "Request review", request_human_review, claim=claim, awakeable_id=approval_id
    )

    # Wait for human approval
    return await approval_promise
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/human_approval_agent.py" />

To implement human approval steps, you can use Restate's awakeables. An awakeable is a promise that can be resolved externally via an API call by providing its ID.
When you create the awakeable, you get back an ID and a promise. You can send the ID to the human approver, and then wait for the promise to be resolved.

<Info>
You can also use awakeables outside of tools, for example, to implement human approval steps in between agent iterations.
</Info>

<Accordion title={"Try out human approval"} icon={"laptop"}>
    Start a request for a high-value claim that needs human approval.
    Use the playground or `curl` with `/send` to start the claim asynchronously, without waiting for the result.
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/HumanClaimApprovalAgent/run/send \
    --json '{"message": "Process my hospital bill of 3000USD for a broken leg."}'
    ```

    You can restart the service to see how Restate continues waiting for the approval.

    If you wait for more than a minute, the invocation will get suspended.

    Simulate approving the claim by executing the **curl request that was printed in the service logs**, similar to:

    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/restate/awakeables/sign_1M28aqY6ZfuwBmRnmyP/resolve --json 'true'
    ```

    See in the UI how the workflow resumes and finishes after the approval.
    <Frame>
        <img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/human-approval.png" alt="Invocation overview" />
    </Frame>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"Timeouts and Escalation"}>
Add timeouts to human approval steps to prevent workflows from hanging indefinitely.

Restate persists the timer and the approval promise, so if the service crashes or is restarted, it will continue waiting with the correct remaining time:

```python human_approval_agent_with_timeout.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/human_approval_agent_with_timeout.py#here"} 
# Wait for human approval for at most 3 hours to reach our SLA
match await restate.select(
    approval=approval_promise,
    timeout=restate_context.sleep(timedelta(hours=3)),
):
    case ["approval", approved]:
        return "Approved" if approved else "Rejected"
    case _:
        return "Approval timed out - Evaluate with AI"
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/human_approval_agent_with_timeout.py" />

Try it out by sending a request to the service:
```bash
curl localhost:8080/HumanClaimApprovalWithTimeoutsAgent/run/send \
--json '{"message": "Process my hospital bill of 3000USD for a broken leg."}'
```
You restart the service and check in the UI how the process will block for the remaining time without starting over.

You can also lower the timeout to a few seconds to see how the timeout path is taken.
</Accordion>


## Resilient workflows as tools

You can pull out complex parts of your tool logic into separate workflows.
This lets you break down complex agents into smaller, reusable components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

The Restate SDK gives you clients to call other Restate services durably from your agent logic.
All calls are proxied via Restate. Restate persists the call and takes care of retries and recovery.

For example, let's implement the human approval tool as a separate service:
```python sub_workflow_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/sub_workflow_agent.py#wf"} 
# Sub-workflow service for human approval
human_approval_workflow = restate.Service("HumanApprovalWorkflow")


@human_approval_workflow.handler("requestApproval")
async def request_approval(
    restate_context: restate.Context, claim: InsuranceClaim
) -> str:
    """Request human approval for a claim and wait for response."""
    # Create an awakeable that can be resolved via HTTP
    approval_id, approval_promise = restate_context.awakeable(type_hint=str)

    # Request human review
    await restate_context.run_typed(
        "Request review", request_human_review, claim=claim, awakeable_id=approval_id
    )

    # Wait for human approval
    return await approval_promise
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/sub_workflow_agent.py" />

This can now be called from the main agent via a service client:
```python sub_workflow_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/sub_workflow_agent.py#here"} 
@function_tool(failure_error_function=raise_restate_errors)
async def human_approval(
    wrapper: RunContextWrapper[restate.Context], claim: InsuranceClaim
) -> str:
    """Ask for human approval for high-value claims using sub-workflow."""
    restate_context = wrapper.context

    # Call the human approval sub-workflow
    return await restate_context.service_call(request_approval, claim)
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/sub_workflow_agent.py" />

These workflows have access to all Restate SDK features, including durable execution, state management, awakeables, and observability.
They can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.


<Accordion title={"Try out sub-workflows"} icon={"laptop"}>
    Start a request for a high-value claim that needs human approval.
    Use `/send` to start the claim asynchronously, without waiting for the result.
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/SubWorkflowClaimApprovalAgent/run/send \
    --json '{"message": "Process my hospital bill of 3000USD for a broken leg."}'
    ```

    In the UI, you can see that the agent called the workflow service and is waiting for the response.
    You can see the trace of the sub-workflow in the timeline.

    Once you approve the claim, the workflow returns, and the agent continues.

    <Frame>
        <img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/sub-workflow.png" alt="Invocation overview" />

## Durable Sessions

The next ingredient we need to build AI agents is the ability to maintain context and memory across multiple interactions.

The OpenAI SDK allows plugging in custom [session providers](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/sessions/) to manage conversation history.

This integrates very well with Restate's stateful entities, called Virtual Objects.

Virtual Objects are Restate's way of implementing stateful services with durable state management and built-in concurrency control.
To implement stateful entities like chat sessions, or stateful agents, Restate provides Virtual Objects.

Each Virtual Object instance maintains isolated state and is identified by a unique key.


### Virtual Objects as OpenAI Session Providers

The Restate OpenAI middleware includes a SessionProvider that automatically persists the agent's conversation history in the Virtual Object state.

Here is an example of a stateful, durable agent represented as a Virtual Object:
<img src="/img/tour/agents/chat_objects.png" alt="Objects"/>

```python chat.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/chat.py?collapse_imports"} 
chat = VirtualObject("Chat")


@chat.handler()
async def message(restate_context: ObjectContext, chat_message: ChatMessage) -> dict:

    restate_session = await RestateSession.create(
        session_id=restate_context.key(), ctx=restate_context
    )

    result = await Runner.run(
        Agent("Assistant", "You are a helpful assistant."),
        input=chat_message.message,
        run_config=RunConfig(
            model="gpt-4o",
            model_provider=DurableModelCalls(restate_context),
            model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False),
        ),
        session=restate_session,
    )
    return result.final_output


@chat.handler(kind="shared")
async def get_history(ctx: ObjectSharedContext):
    return await ctx.get("items") or []
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/chat.py" />

Virtual Objects are ideal for implementing any entity with mutable state:
- **Long-lived state**: K/V state is stored permanently. It has no automatic expiry. Clear it via `ctx.clear()`.
- **Durable state changes**: State changes are logged with Durable Execution, so they survive failures and are consistent with code execution
- **State is queryable** via the state tab in the UI.
<Frame>
<img src="/img/tour/agents/conversations.png" alt="Conversation State Management" />
</Frame>
- **Built-in concurrency control**: Restate’s Virtual Objects have built-in queuing and consistency guarantees per object key. Handlers either have read-write access (`ObjectContext`) or read-only access (shared object context).
    - Only one handler with write access can run at a time per object key to prevent concurrent/lost writes or race conditions (for example `message()`).
    - Handlers with read-only access can run concurrently to the write-access handlers (for example `get_history()`).
<img src="/img/tour/agents/chat_queue.png" alt="Queue"/>

<Accordion title={"Try out Virtual Objects"} icon={"laptop"}>
    **Stateful Chat Agent:**

    Ask the agent to do some task:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session123/message \
    --json '{"message": "Make a poem about durable execution."}'
    ```

    Continue the conversation - the agent remembers previous context:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session123/message \
    --json '{"message": "Shorten it to 2 lines."}'
    ```

    Get conversation history or view it in the UI:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session123/getHistory
    ```

    **Seeing concurrency control in action:**

    In the chat service, the `message` handler is an exclusive handler, while the `getHistory` handler is a shared handler.

    Let's send some messages to a chat session:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session123/message/send --json '{"message": "make a poem about durable execution"}' &
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session456/message/send --json '{"message": "what are the benefits of durable execution?"}' &
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session789/message/send --json '{"message": "how does workflow orchestration work?"}' &
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session123/message/send --json '{"message": "can you make it rhyme better?"}' &
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session456/message/send --json '{"message": "what about fault tolerance in distributed systems?"}' &
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session789/message/send --json '{"message": "give me a practical example"}' &
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session101/message/send --json '{"message": "explain event sourcing in simple terms"}' &
    curl localhost:8080/Chat/session202/message/send --json '{"message": "what is the difference between async and sync processing?"}'
    ```

    The UI shows how Restate queues the requests per session to ensure consistency:
    <Frame>
        <img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/exclusive-handlers.png" alt="Conversation State Management" />
    </Frame>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"Stateful Serverless Agents"}>
    You can run Virtual Objects on serverless platforms like Modal, Render, or AWS Lambda.
    When the request comes in, Restate attaches the correct state to the request, so your handler can access it locally.

    This way, you can implement [stateful, serverless agents without managing any external state store](https://www.restate.dev/blog/resilient-serverless-agents#cost-efficiency-scaling-to-zero-while-waiting) and without worrying about concurrency issues.
</Accordion>


### Virtual Objects for storing context

You can store any context information in Virtual Objects, for example, user preferences or the last agent they interacted with.

Use `ctx.set` and `ctx.get` in your handler to store and retrieve state.

We will show an example of this in the next section when we orchestrate multiple agents.


## Resilient multi-agent coordination

As your agents grow more complex, you may want to break them down into smaller, specialized agents that can delegate tasks to each other.

Similar to sub-workflows, you can break down complex agents into multiple specialized agents.

All agents can run in the same process or be deployed independently.

### Agents as tools/handoffs

If you want to share context between agents, run the agents in the same process and use handoffs or tools.

You don't need to do anything special to make this work with Restate.

Use Virtual Object state to maintain context between runs. For example, store the last agent that was called in the object state, so the user can connect back seamlessly on the next interaction:

```python multi_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/multi_agent.py?collapse_imports"} 
intake_agent = Agent[restate.ObjectContext](
    name="IntakeAgent",
    instructions="Route insurance claims to the appropriate specialist: medical, auto, or property.",
)

medical_specialist = Agent[restate.ObjectContext](
    name="MedicalSpecialist",
    handoff_description="I handle medical insurance claims from intake to final decision.",
    instructions="Review medical claims for coverage and necessity. Approve/deny up to $50,000.",
)

auto_specialist = Agent[restate.ObjectContext](
    name="AutoSpecialist",
    handoff_description="I handle auto insurance claims from intake to final decision.",
    instructions="Assess auto claims for liability and damage. Approve/deny up to $25,000.",
)

# Configure handoffs so intake agent can route to specialists
intake_agent.handoffs = [medical_specialist, auto_specialist]

agent_dict = {
    "IntakeAgent": intake_agent,
    "MedicalSpecialist": medical_specialist,
    "AutoSpecialist": auto_specialist,
}

agent_service = restate.VirtualObject("MultiAgentClaimApproval")


@agent_service.handler()
async def run(restate_context: restate.ObjectContext, claim: InsuranceClaim) -> str:

    # Store context in Restate's key-value store
    last_agent_name = (
        await restate_context.get("last_agent_name", type_hint=str) or "IntakeAgent"
    )
    last_agent = agent_dict.get(last_agent_name, intake_agent)

    restate_session = await RestateSession.create(
        session_id=restate_context.key(), ctx=restate_context
    )
    result = await Runner.run(
        last_agent,
        input=f"Claim: {claim.model_dump_json()}",
        context=restate_context,
        run_config=RunConfig(
            model="gpt-4o",
            model_provider=DurableModelCalls(restate_context),
            model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False),
        ),
        session=restate_session,
    )

    restate_context.set("last_agent_name", result.last_agent.name)

    return result.final_output
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/multi_agent.py" />

The execution trace in the Restate UI will allow you to see the full chain of calls between agents and their individual steps.


<Accordion title={"Try out multi-agent systems"} icon={"laptop"}>
    Start a request for a claim that needs to be analyzed by multiple agents.
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8080/MultiAgentClaimApproval/session123/run --json '{
        "date":"2024-10-01",
        "category":"orthopedic",
        "reason":"hospital bill for a broken leg",
        "amount":3000,
        "placeOfService":"General Hospital"
    }'
    ```

    In the UI, you can see that the agent called the sub-agents and is waiting for their responses.
    You can see the trace of the sub-agents in the timeline.

    Once all sub-agents return, the main agent continues and makes a decision.

    <Frame>
        <img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/multi-agent.png" alt="Invocation overview" />
    </Frame>

    The state now contains the last agent that was called, so you can continue the conversation directly with the same agent:
    <Frame>
        <img src="/img/tour/agents/openai/multi-agent-state.png" alt="Invocation overview" />
    </Frame>
</Accordion>

### Remote agents as tools

If you want to run agents independently, for example, to scale them separately, run them on different platforms, or let them get developed by different teams, then you can call them as tools via service calls.

Restate will proxy all calls, persist them, and will guarantee that they complete successfully.

Your main agent can suspend and save resources while waiting for the remote agent to finish.
Restate invokes your main agent again once the remote agent returns.

```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/multi_agent.py" />

Note, any shared context between agents needs to be passed explicitly via the input.

The execution trace in the Restate UI will allow you to see the full chain of calls between agents and their individual steps.

<Warning>
You cannot put both agents within the same Virtual Object, because this leads to deadlocks.
The main agent would block on the call to the sub-agent, preventing the sub-agent from executing, cause only one handler can run at a time per object key.

## Parallel Work

Now that our agents are broken down into smaller parts, let's have a look at how to run different parts of our agent logic in parallel to speed up execution.

<Warning>
    When using the OpenAI Agent SDK with Restate, tool calls are executed sequentially by default to ensure deterministic execution during replays.
    When multiple tools execute in parallel and use the Restate Context, the order of operations might differ between the original execution and the replay, leading to inconsistencies.
</Warning>

Restate provides primitives that allow you to run tasks concurrently while maintaining deterministic execution during replays.

Most actions on the Restate Context can be composed using `restate.gather` to gather their results or `restate.select` to wait for the first one to complete.


### Parallel Tool Steps

To parallelize tool steps, implement an orchestrator tool that uses durable execution to run multiple steps in parallel.

Here is an insurance claim agent tool that runs multiple analyses in parallel:

```python parallel_tools_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/parallel_tools_agent.py#here"} 
@function_tool(failure_error_function=raise_restate_errors)
async def calculate_metrics(
    wrapper: RunContextWrapper[restate.Context], claim: InsuranceClaim
) -> list[str]:
    """Calculate claim metrics."""
    restate_context = wrapper.context

    # Run tools/steps in parallel with durable execution
    results_done = await restate.gather(
        restate_context.run_typed("eligibility", check_eligibility, claim=claim),
        restate_context.run_typed("cost", compare_to_standard_rates, claim=claim),
        restate_context.run_typed("fraud", check_fraud, claim=claim),
    )
    return [await result for result in results_done]
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/parallel_tools_agent.py" />
Restate makes sure that all parallel tasks are retried and recovered until they succeed.

<Info>
If you want to allow the LLM to call multiple tools in parallel, then you need to [manually implement the agent tool execution loop](#advanced-patterns) using `restate.select` and durable promises.
</Info>

<Accordion title={"Try out parallel tool steps"} icon={"laptop"}>

        "amount":3000,
        "placeOfService":"General Hospital"
    }'
    ```

    In the UI, you can see that the agent ran the tool steps in parallel.
    Their traces all start at the same time.

    Once all tools return, the agent continues and makes a decision.

</Accordion>

### Parallel Agents

You can use the same durable execution primitives to run multiple agents in parallel.

For example, to race agents against each other and [use the first result that returns](/develop/ts/concurrent-tasks#wait-for-the-first-successful-completion), while [cancelling the others](/foundations/invocations#cancelling-invocations).

Or to let a main orchestrator agent combine the results of multiple specialized agents in parallel:

```python parallel_agents.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/parallel_agents.py#here"} 
@agent_service.handler()
async def run(restate_context: restate.Context, claim: InsuranceClaim) -> str:

    # Start multiple agents in parallel with auto retries and recovery
    eligibility = restate_context.service_call(run_eligibility_agent, claim)
    cost = restate_context.service_call(run_rate_comparison_agent, claim)
    fraud = restate_context.service_call(run_fraud_agent, claim)

    # Wait for all responses
    await restate.gather(eligibility, cost, fraud)

    # Run decision agent on outputs
    result = await Runner.run(
        Agent(
            name="ClaimApprovalAgent", instructions="You are a claim decision engine."
        ),
        input=f"Decide about claim: {claim.model_dump_json()}. "
        "Base your decision on the following analyses:"
        f"Eligibility: {await eligibility} Cost {await cost} Fraud: {await fraud}",
        run_config=RunConfig(
            model="gpt-4o",
            model_provider=DurableModelCalls(restate_context),
            model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False),
        ),
    )
    return result.final_output
```

## Error Handling
LLM calls are costly, so you can configure retry behavior in both Restate and your AI SDK to avoid infinite loops and high costs.

Restate distinguishes between two types of errors:
- **Transient errors**: Temporary issues like network failures or rate limits. Restate automatically retries these until they succeed or the retry policy is exhausted.
- **Terminal errors**: Permanent failures like invalid input or business rule violations. Restate does not retry these. The invocation fails permanently. You can catch these errors and handle them gracefully.

You can throw a terminal error via:

```python
from restate import TerminalError

raise TerminalError("This tool is not allowed to run for this input.")
```

You can catch and handle terminal errors in your agent logic if needed.

Many AI SDKs also have their own retry behavior for LLM calls and tool executions, so let's look at how these interact.

### Retries of LLM calls

Restate's `DurableModelCalls` provider lets you specify the maximum number of retries for LLM calls.

```python
run_config=RunConfig(
    model="gpt-4o",
    model_provider=DurableModelCalls(restate_context, max_retries=3),
    model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False)
),
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/errorhandling_fail_on_terminal_tool_agent.py" />

By default, the middleware retries three times. Once Restate's retries are exhausted, the invocation fails with a `TerminalError` and won't be retried further.

### Tool execution errors

By default, the OpenAI Agent SDK will convert any error in tool execution into a message to the LLM, and the LLM will decide how to proceed.
This is often desirable, as the LLM can decide to retry the tool call, use a different tool, or provide a fallback answer.

#### Surfacing suspensions and terminal errors
There are some Restate errors that should not be handled by the LLM, for example, if a tool execution is suspended waiting for human input.
Restate lets tool executions suspend if they need to wait for a long time. This suspension is started by raising an artificial error.
These errors should be re-raised by the agent, instead of ingested.

Therefore, you should always set your tool's `failure_error_function` to raise Restate errors like suspensions.

```python error_handling.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/error_handling.py#here"}
@function_tool(failure_error_function=raise_restate_errors)
async def get_weather(
    wrapper: RunContextWrapper[restate.Context], req: WeatherRequest
) -> WeatherResponse:
    """Get the current weather for a given city."""
    restate_context = wrapper.context
    return await restate_context.run_typed("Get weather", fetch_weather, city=req.city)
```

This error function will also re-raise any terminal errors that happen during tool execution.

You can then handle the terminal error in your agent logic if needed, or let it fail the invocation:
```python error_handling.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/error_handling.py#handle"}
try:
    result = await Runner.run(
        weather_agent,
        input=prompt.message,
        context=restate_context,
        run_config=RunConfig(
            model="gpt-4o",
            model_provider=DurableModelCalls(restate_context, max_retries=2),
            model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False),
        ),
    )
except restate.TerminalError as e:
    # Handle terminal errors gracefully
    return "The agent couldn't complete the request."
```


<Warning>
    The OpenAI Agent SDK also allows setting `failure_error_function` to `None`, which will rethrow any error in the agent execution as-is.
    Also for example invalid LLM responses (e.g. tool call with invalid arguments or to a tool that doesn't exist).
    The error will then lead to Restate retries. Restate will recover the invocation by replaying the journal entries.
    This can lead to infinite retries if the error is not transient.
    Therefore, be careful when using this option and handle errors appropriately in your agent logic.
    You also might want to set [a retry policy at the service or handler level](/services/configuration#how-to-configure) to avoid infinite retries.
</Warning>

#### Retry-ing transient errors

If you use Restate Context actions like `ctx.run` in your tool execution, Restate will retry any transient errors in these actions until they succeed.
So for all operations that might suffer from transient errors (like network calls, database interactions, etc.), you should use Context actions to make them resilient.

Here is a small practical example:
```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/tour/agents/inline-tool-errors.ts#here"} 
// Without ctx.run - error goes straight to agent
async function myTool() {
  const result = await fetch('/api/data'); // Might fail due to network
  // If this fails, agent gets the error immediately
}

// With ctx.run - Restate handles retries
async function myToolWithRestate(ctx: restate.Context) {
  const result = await ctx.run('fetch-data', () =>
      fetch('/api/data')
  );
  // Network failures get retried automatically
  // Only terminal errors (like 404) reach the AI
}
```


<Info>
You can set [custom retry policies](/guides/error-handling#at-the-run-block-level) for `ctx.run` steps in your tool executions.
</Info>


## Advanced patterns

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Manual Agent Loop">
If you need more control over the agent loop, you can implement it manually using Restate's durable primitives.

This allows you to:
- Parallelize tool calls with [`restate.select`](/develop/python/concurrent-tasks#select) and [`restate.gather`](/develop/python/concurrent-tasks#waiting-for-all-tasks-to-complete)
- Implement custom stopping conditions
- Implement custom logic between steps (e.g. human approval)
- Interact with external systems between steps
- Handle errors in a custom way

Here is an example of a manual agent loop:

```python advanced/manual_loop_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/advanced/manual_loop_agent.py?collapse_imports"}

            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location"
        }
    }
]


async def get_weather(restate_context: Context, req: WeatherRequest) -> WeatherResponse:
    """Get the current weather in a given location"""
    return await restate_context.run_typed("Get weather", fetch_weather, city=req.city)


manual_loop_agent = restate.Service("ManualLoopAgent")


class MultiWeatherPrompt(BaseModel):
    message: str = "What is the weather like in New York and San Francisco?"

@manual_loop_agent.handler()
async def run(ctx: Context, prompt: MultiWeatherPrompt) -> str:
    """Main agent loop with tool calling"""
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt.message}]

    while True:
        # Call OpenAI with durable execution
        response = await ctx.run_typed(
            "llm-call",
            client.chat.completions.create,
            restate.RunOptions(max_attempts=3,
                           type_hint=ChatCompletion),  # To avoid using too many credits on infinite retries during development
            model="gpt-4o",
            tools=TOOLS,
            messages=messages,
        )

        # Save function call outputs for subsequent requests
        assistant_message = response.choices[0].message
        messages.append(assistant_message)

        if not assistant_message.tool_calls:
            return assistant_message.content

        # Check if we need to call tools
        for tool_call in assistant_message.tool_calls:
            if tool_call.function.name == "get_weather":
                tool_output = await get_weather(ctx, WeatherRequest(**json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)))

                # Add tool response to messages
                messages.append({
                    "role": "tool",
                    "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                    "content": tool_output.model_dump_json()
                })
```
<GitHubLink url="https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/advanced/manual_loop_agent.py" />

This can be extended to include any custom control flow you need: persistent state, parallel tool calls, custom stopping conditions, or custom error handling.

Try it out by sending a request to the service:
```bash
curl localhost:8080/ManualLoopAgent/run \
--json '{"message": "What is the weather like in New York and San Francisco?"}'
```

In the UI, you can see how the agent runs multiple iterations and calls tools.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Rolling back tool executions on failure">

Sometimes you need to undo previous agent actions when a later step fails. Restate makes it easy to implement compensation patterns (Sagas) for AI agents.

Just track the rollback actions as you go, let the agent rethrow terminal tool errors, and execute the rollback actions in reverse order.

Here is an example of a travel booking agent that first reserves a hotel, flight and car, and then either confirms them or rolls back if any step fails with a terminal error (e.g. car type not available).

We let tools add rollback actions to the agent context for each booking step the do.
The `run` handler catches any terminal errors and runs all the rollback actions.
```python advanced/rollback_agent.py {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/tour_openai/openai-agents/tour-of-agents/app/advanced/rollback_agent.py?collapse_imports"}
