Restate lets you persist key-value (K/V) state using its embedded K/V store.


## Key Characteristics

<Tip>
All state updates are **journaled alongside other context actions** (e.g., `run`, calls) in the same execution log.
This ensures **strong consistency**: your state is always in sync with the exact point of execution, making it safe to use in distributed or failure-prone environments.
</Tip> 

**State is only available for Virtual Objects and Workflows.**

Scope: 
- For Virtual Objects: State is scoped per object key and retained indefinitely. It is persisted and shared across all invocations for that object until explicitly cleared.
- For Workflows: State is scoped per workflow execution (workflow ID) and retained only for the duration of the workflowâ€™s configured retention time.

Access Rules:
- [Exclusive handlers](/ts/overview#exclusive-vs-shared-handlers) (e.g., run in workflows) can read and write state.
- [Shared handlers](/ts/overview#exclusive-vs-shared-handlers) can only read state and cannot mutate it.

<Note>
    You can inspect and edit the K/V state via the UI and the [CLI](/operate/introspection#inspecting-application-state).
</Note>

<Note>
By default, results are serialized using [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON). See the [serialization docs](/develop/ts/serialization) to customize this.
</Note>

## List all state keys
Use [`ctx.stateKeys()`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ObjectContext#statekeys) to retrieve all keys for which the current Virtual Object has stored state:

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#statekeys}
const stateKeys = ctx.stateKeys();
```

## Get state value
Use [`ctx.get<T>()`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ObjectContext#get-1) to read a value by key. Returns null if the key doesn't exist.

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#get}
const myString = (await ctx.get<string>("my-string-key")) ?? "my-default";
const myNumber = (await ctx.get<number>("my-number-key")) ?? 0;
```

## Set state value
Use [`ctx.set()`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ObjectContext#set-1) to write or update a value:

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#set}
ctx.set("my-key", "my-new-value");
```

## Clear state key
Use [`ctx.clear()`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ObjectContext#clear) to delete a specific key:

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#clear}
ctx.clear("my-key");
```

## Clear all state keys

Use [`ctx.clearAll()`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ObjectContext#clearall) to remove all stored state for the current Virtual Object:

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#clear_all}
ctx.clearAll();
```
