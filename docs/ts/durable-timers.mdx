The Restate SDK includes durable timers.
You can use these to let handlers sleep for a specified time, or to schedule a handler to be called at a later time.
These timers are resilient to failures and restarts.
Restate stores and keeps track of the timers and triggers them on time, even across failures and restarts.

## Scheduling async tasks

To invoke a handler at a later time, use delayed messages.

See the documentation on [delayed messages](/ts/service-communication#delayed-messages) for more details.

## Durable sleep
To pause a handler for a set duration:

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/durable_timers.ts#sleep}
await ctx.sleep({ seconds: 10 });
```

<Tip>
    If your handler runs on function-as-a-service platforms like AWS Lambda, Restate suspends the handler while it is sleeping, to free up resources.
   Since these platforms charge on execution time, this saves costs
</Tip>

<Tip>
    If you sleep in an exclusive handler in a Virtual Object, all other calls to this object will be queued.  
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Clock synchronization Restate Server vs. SDK">
    The Restate SDK calculates the wake-up time based on the delay you specify.
    The Restate Server then uses this calculated time to wake up the handler.
    If the Restate Server and the SDK have different system clocks, the sleep duration might not be accurate.
    So make sure that the system clock of the Restate Server and the SDK have the same timezone and are synchronized.
    A mismatch can cause timers to fire earlier or later than expected.

## Timers and timeouts

[`RestatePromise`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/types/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RestatePromise)  support timeouts, allowing you to bound how long your code waits for an operation.

When an operation times out, it throws a [`TimeoutError`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/classes/_restatedev_restate-sdk.TimeoutError).

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/durable_timers.ts#timer}
try {
  await ctx.serviceClient(MyService).myHandler("Hi")
      .orTimeout({ seconds: 5 });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof restate.TimeoutError) {
    console.error("Operation timed out:", error);
  } else {
    throw error; // Re-throw other errors
  }
}
```

## Cron jobs

Restate does not yet include native cron support, but you can implement your own cron scheduler using:
- Durable timers
- Virtual Objects
- A repeat loop or sleep-schedule pattern

Check out the guide on [implementing cron jobs](/guides/cron-jobs).
