The Restate TypeScript SDK is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript).

<Note>
**Prerequisites:**  
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v18.17.1 or [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) or [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation)  
- [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 9.6.7
</Note>

## Getting started 
<Tip>
    Get started quickly with the [TypeScript Quickstart](/get_started/quickstart?sdk=ts).
</Tip>

Add the [`@restatedev/restate-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@restatedev/restate-sdk) dependency to your project to start developing Restate services.

The Restate SDK lets you implement **handlers**. Handlers can be part of a **Service**, a **Virtual Object**, or a **Workflow**. This page introduces each concept and shows how to define them.


## Services

Services are the fundamental units in Restate. They group related **handlers** and expose them as callable endpoints.

Here’s a basic example of a service:

```ts
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const myService = restate.service({
  name: "MyService",
  handlers: {
    myHandler: async (ctx: restate.Context, greeting: string) => {
      return `${greeting}!`;
    },
  },
});

export const MyService: typeof myService = { name: "MyService" };

restate.endpoint().bind(myService).listen();
```


* Define a service using [`restate.service`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/functions/_restatedev_restate-sdk.service).
* Set a `name` for the service. Its handlers become accessible at:
  `http://<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/<ServiceName>/<HandlerName>`
* Handlers:

  * Are functions mapped to names (e.g., `myHandler`)
  * Accept a [`Context`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context) as the first argument.
  * May take one optional input and return any JSON-serializable value.
    See [Serialization](/develop/ts/serialization) for advanced types (e.g., Zod)
* Export the service definition to be able to call it with typed clients from other services. See [Service Communication](/develop/ts/service-communication).
* Use [`endpoint().bind(...).listen()`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RestateEndpoint) to expose the service over HTTP (port `9080` by default).

## Virtual Objects

Virtual Objects are like services, but stateful and key-addressable — each object instance has a unique ID and persistent state.

```ts
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const myObject = restate.object({
  name: "MyObject",
  handlers: {
    myHandler: async (ctx: restate.ObjectContext, greeting: string) => {
      return `${greeting} ${ctx.key}!`;
    },
    myConcurrentHandler: restate.handlers.object.shared(
      async (ctx: restate.ObjectSharedContext, greeting: string) => {
        return `${greeting} ${ctx.key}!`;
      }
    ),
  },
});

export const MyObject: typeof myObject = { name: "MyObject" };

restate.endpoint().bind(myObject).listen();
```

* Define a Virtual Object using [`restate.object(...)`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/functions/_restatedev_restate-sdk.object)
* Each instance is identified by a `key` (accessible via `ctx.key`) and can store persistent K/V state.
* Virtual Objects can have [exclusive and shared handlers](/ts/overview#exclusive-vs-shared-handlers). 
* Exclusive handlers receive an [`ObjectContext`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ObjectContext), allowing:
  * Read/write access to object state
  * Access to the object key (`ctx.key`)
* Only one exclusive handler runs at a time per object for consistency ([learn more](/ts/overview#exclusive-vs-shared-handlers)).
* Use [`handlers.object.shared(...)`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/functions/_restatedev_restate-sdk.handlers.object.shared) to define **concurrent** read-only handlers with [`ObjectSharedContext`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ObjectSharedContext)


## Workflows

Workflows are long-lived processes with a defined lifecycle. They run once per key and are ideal for orchestrating multi-step operations, which require external interaction via signals and queries.

```ts
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const myWorkflow = restate.workflow({
  name: "MyWorkflow",
  handlers: {
    run: async (ctx: restate.WorkflowContext, req: string) => {
      // orchestrate your workflow logic here
      return "success";
    },

    interactWithWorkflow: async (ctx: restate.WorkflowSharedContext) => {
      // signal, resolve a promise, or query state
    },
  },
});

export const MyWorkflow: typeof myWorkflow = { name: "MyWorkflow" };

restate.endpoint().bind(myWorkflow).listen();
```


* Define a workflow with [`restate.workflow(...)`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/functions/_restatedev_restate-sdk.workflow)
* Every workflow **must** include a `run` handler:

  * This is the main orchestration entry point
  * It runs exactly once per workflow execution and uses [`WorkflowContext`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.WorkflowContext)
  * Use `ctx.key` to access the workflow's unique ID
  * Compose logic from SDK actions (e.g., [`sleep`](/develop/ts/durable-timers), [`run block`](/develop/ts/journaling-results#journaled-actions), [set K/V state](/ts/state#setting-state) or service calls)
* Additional handlers must use the [`WorkflowSharedContext`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.WorkflowSharedContext) and can:

  * Query workflow state
  * Send signals
  * Run concurrently with the `run` handler and even after it finishes ([learn more](/ts/overview#exclusive-vs-shared-handlers))

Learn more in the [Workflows guide](/develop/ts/workflows).

## Exclusive vs. Shared Handlers

Virtual Objects and Workflows can have two types of handlers: **exclusive** handlers and **shared** handlers:

### Exclusive Handlers
* Use `ObjectContext` or `WorkflowContext`.
* Can **read and write** state (`ctx.set`, `ctx.clear`, etc.).
* Only **one exclusive handler** can run at a time per Virtual Object key or Workflow execution.
* Calls to exclusive handlers are **queued** and executed sequentially to ensure state consistency.
* This serialization guarantees that concurrent writes don't conflict or overwrite each other.

⚠️ **Why this matters:**
If two exclusive handlers were allowed to run concurrently, Restate couldn't safely determine which write is the final one. Serial execution avoids this race condition.

### Shared Handlers
* Use `ObjectSharedContext` or `WorkflowSharedContext`.
* Can **only read** state—**no write access**.
* Do **not block** or queue—they can run concurrently with other handlers, including an ongoing exclusive handler.

### When to Use Shared Handlers

Shared handlers are useful for **interacting with long-running exclusive handlers** without blocking or waiting:

* Example: A long-running workflow updates a status in its state.
* Meanwhile, a dashboard can read that status using a shared handler without interrupting or waiting on the main workflow.
