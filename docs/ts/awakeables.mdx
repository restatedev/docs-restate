title: "Awakeables"
description: "Pause and resume invocations using the callback (task token) pattern."
---

**Awakeables** allow you to pause an invocation while waiting for another process to complete a task. This enables a handler to delegate work elsewhere and resume once the result is available. This pattern is also known as the **callback** or **task token** pattern.


## How Awakeables Work

1. **Create an awakeable**  
   Generate an awakeable, which provides a unique string identifier and a Promise.
2. **Trigger an external task**  
   Start a task or process elsewhere, passing along the awakeable ID (e.g., via Kafka, HTTP, etc.).  
3. **Wait for completion**  
   The handler pauses and waits for the external process to complete the task and respond.  
   Once the result is available, the handler resumes with the payload.

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/awakeable.ts}
const { id, promise } = ctx.awakeable<string>();
await ctx.run(() => triggerTaskAndDeliverId(id));
const payload = await promise;
```


<Note>
  The TypeScript SDK uses built-in [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) for (de)serialization by default. See the [serialization docs](/develop/ts/serialization) for customization options.
</Note>

<Tip>
  On Function-as-a-Service platforms like AWS Lambda, Restate suspends the handler while waiting for the awakeable. **You are only billed for active execution time, not for waiting.**
</Tip> 

<Warning>
  Virtual Objects process one invocation at a time. While waiting on an awakeable, the Virtual Object is blocked and cannot process other invocations.
</Warning>

## Completing Awakeables

The external process completes the awakeable by either:

- **Resolving** it with an optional payload, or
- **Rejecting** it with a reason for failure.

If rejected, a [terminal error](/develop/ts/error-handling) is thrown in the waiting handler.

### Completing Awakeables via HTTP

- **Resolve** (with ID and optional payload):
  ```shell
  curl localhost:8080/restate/awakeables/prom_1PePOqp/resolve \
    --json '{"hello": "world"}'
  ```


- **Reject** (with ID and reason):
  ```shell
  curl localhost:8080/restate/awakeables/prom_1PePOqp/reject \
    -H 'content-type: text/plain' \
    -d 'Very bad error!'
  ```

### Completing Awakeables via the SDK

- **Resolve**:
```ts  {CODE_LOAD::../snippets/ts/src/develop/awakeable.ts#resolve}
ctx.resolveAwakeable(id, "hello");
```

- **Reject**:
```ts  {CODE_LOAD::../snippets/ts/src/develop/awakeable.ts#reject}
ctx.rejectAwakeable(id, "my error reason");
```
