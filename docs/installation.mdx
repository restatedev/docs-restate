Set up Restate locally in minutes.

## Install Restate Server & CLI

<InstallRestate/>

Check out the [CLI](/references/cli-config) or [Server configuration options](/server/configuration).

<Info title="Telemetry">
  Restate Server collects anonymized telemetry about versions and uptime via [Scarf](https://about.scarf.sh).  
  We don't have access to your IP or any information about your cluster.
  To disable, set `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.
</Info>


## Restate UI

The UI is bundled with the Restate Server and available at [http://localhost:9070](http://localhost:9070) when running locally. Use the UI to manage, debug, and configure your applications.


## Useful CLI Commands

With the CLI installed, try these commands:

## Advanced: Installing `restatectl`

`restatectl` is a command-line tool for managing Restate clusters. It provides commands for cluster management, introspection, and debugging.

This tool is specifically designed for system operators to manage Restate servers and is particularly useful in a cluster environment.

        Install with:
        ```shell
        brew install restatedev/tap/restatectl

    <Tab title="Download binaries">
        Install restatectl by downloading the binary with `curl` from the [releases page](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases/latest), and make them executable:

        <CodeGroup>

            ```shell Linux-x64
            BIN=$HOME/.local/bin && RESTATE_PLATFORM=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl && \
            curl -LO https://restate.gateway.scarf.sh/latest/restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz && \
            tar -xvf restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz --strip-components=1 restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM/restatectl && \
            chmod +x restatectl && \

            # Move the binary to a directory in your PATH, for example ~/.local/bin:
            mv restatectl $BIN
            ```

            ```shell Linux-arm64
            BIN=$HOME/.local/bin && RESTATE_PLATFORM=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl && \
            curl -LO https://restate.gateway.scarf.sh/latest/restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz && \
            tar -xvf restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz --strip-components=1 restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM/restatectl && \
            chmod +x restatectl && \

            # Move the binary to a directory in your PATH, for example ~/.local/bin:
            mv restatectl $BIN
            ```

            ```shell MacOS-x64
            BIN=/usr/local/bin && RESTATE_PLATFORM=x86_64-apple-darwin && \
            curl -LO https://restate.gateway.scarf.sh/latest/restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz && \
            tar -xvf restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz --strip-components=1 restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM/restatectl && \
            chmod +x restatectl && \

            # Move the binary to a directory in your PATH, for example /usr/local/bin (needs sudo):
            sudo mv restatectl $BIN
            ```

            ```shell MacOS-arm64
            BIN=/usr/local/bin && RESTATE_PLATFORM=aarch64-apple-darwin && \
            curl -LO https://restate.gateway.scarf.sh/latest/restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz && \
            tar -xvf restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM.tar.xz --strip-components=1 restatectl-$RESTATE_PLATFORM/restatectl && \
            chmod +x restatectl && \

            # Move the binary to a directory in your PATH, for example /usr/local/bin (needs sudo):
            sudo mv restatectl $BIN
            ```

        </CodeGroup>

        Then run:
        ```shell
        restatectl --help
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="npm">
        Install with:
        ```shell
        npm install --global @restatedev/restatectl@latest
        ```
        Then run:
        ```shell
        restatectl --help
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Docker">

        The server image contains the `restatectl` tool. To run `restatectl`, use the following command:

        ```shell
        docker run -it --network=host --entrypoint restatectl docker.restate.dev/restatedev/restate:latest nodes ls
        ```

        You can also execute `restatectl` in a running server container using the following command:

        ```shell
        docker exec restate_dev restatectl nodes ls
        ```

        Replace `restate_dev` with the name of a running container, and `nodes ls` with the subcommand you want to run.

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
    `restatectl` requires direct access to nodes via their advertised addresses (default port: 5122). Ensure that restatectl commands can reach these addresses.
