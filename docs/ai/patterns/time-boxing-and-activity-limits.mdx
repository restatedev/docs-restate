## Time limits

Execution time limits


## Step limits

max iterations

Pausing & resuming jobs

Setting execution boundaries
Graceful degradation patterns
Cleanup after timeout scenarios


## Budget-aware execution
Token/cost tracking across LLM calls
Pausing when approaching limits
Budget reallocation between agents
