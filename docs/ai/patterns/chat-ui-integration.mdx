This guide explains how to invoke Restate services from frontend applications using the Restate SDK clients or plain HTTP requests.

## Calling agents from the frontend

You can call your agents in two ways:
1. Via the SDK clients (type-safe, recommended). Supported for [TypeScript](/services/invocation/clients/typescript-sdk),
                                                          [Python](/services/invocation/clients/python-sdk),
                                                          [Java](/services/invocation/clients/java-sdk),
                                                          [Go](/services/invocation/clients/go-sdk).
2. Via [plain HTTP requests](/services/invocation/http) (works anywhere in any language).

Restate supports calling your agents via:
- **Request-response**: short operations where the user is waiting (< few seconds)
- **Fire-and-forget**: longer operations where you'll receive updates via a separate channel ([pubsub](/ai/patterns/streaming-responses)/webhooks) or want to retrieve the result later
- **Scheduled/delayed calls**: schedules a request to an agent with a delay

### Example: TypeScript SDK client

Install the Restate SDK clients package:

```bash
npm install @restatedev/restate-sdk-clients
```

[Export the type definition](/develop/ts/service-communication#advanced:-sharing-service-type-definitions) of your agent:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/ai/guides/my_agent.ts#export"} 
export type MyAgent = typeof myAgent;
```

Create a client connection to the Restate ingress, then use the client for your service type to send a request:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/ai/guides/ui_sdk_clients.ts#here"} 
// import * as clients from "@restatedev/restate-sdk-clients";
// import {MyAgent} from "./my_agent";

const ingress = clients.connect({ url: "http://localhost:8080" });

// Send a message without waiting for completion
const handle = await ingress
  .serviceSendClient<MyAgent>({ name: "my-agent" })
  .run({ message: "How are you?" });
```

Consult the [client SDK docs](/services/invocation/clients/typescript-sdk) to learn about calling Virtual Objects or doing other types of calls.

### Example: Next.js API Route

You can use the SDK clients to send requests from your NextJS app to Restate services.

Here's an example of an API route that calls a Restate service:

```typescript app/agent/[topic]/api/route.ts {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/ai-examples/refs/heads/main/vercel-ai/nextjs-example-app/app/agent/%5Btopic%5D/api/route.ts"} 
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import * as clients from "@restatedev/restate-sdk-clients";
import { Agent } from "@/restate/services/agent";

export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ topic: string }> },
) {
  const { topic } = await params;
  const { message } = await request.json();
  const ingressUrl = process.env.INGRESS_URL || "http://localhost:8080";

  const ingress = clients.connect({ url: ingressUrl });

  await ingress
    .serviceSendClient<Agent>({ name: "agent" })
    .chat({ prompt: message, topic });

  return Response.json({ ok: true });
}
```

### Using HTTP requests

You can also call Restate services using plain HTTP requests without the SDK.

For example, in JavaScript:
```javascript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/ai/guides/http_requests.js#here"} 
// Request-response
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/my-agent/run", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: "How are you?" }),
});
const result = await response.json();

// Fire-and-forget: add /send to the URL
await fetch("http://localhost:8080/my-agent/run/send", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: "How are you?" }),
});
```



## Request deduplication / idempotency

You can let Restate deduplicate requests by adding an idempotency key to the header of your request.

```javascript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/ai/guides/http_requests.js#idempotency"} 
await fetch("http://localhost:8080/my-agent/run/send", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "idempotency-key": "abc-123",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify("How are you?"),
});
```

This can help with implementing retries and avoiding rage clicking to lead to many invocations.

## Re-attach to executions

Restate lets you re-attach to ongoing executions. This is useful to retrieve the response from another processs, for example after a crash or as part of your application logic.idempotency

There are three ways to do this:
1. If you use an idempotency key, then sending the same request with the same idempotency key will re-attach you to the original invocation.

2. If you have the invocation ID, then you can use that to attach to it:

```javascript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/ai/guides/http_requests.js#attach"} 
// start the invocation
const handle = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/agent/run/send", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify("How are you?"),
});

// retrieve the invocationId
const { invocationId, status } = await handle.json();

// retrieve the result
const result = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8080/restate/invocation/${invocationId}/attach`,
  { method: "GET" }
);
await result.json();
```

3. If you started the invocation with an idempotency key, then you can use that to attach to it. This does not start the invocation as opposed to point 1:

```javascript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/ai/guides/http_requests.js#attach_idem"} 
// start the invocation with idempotency key
const idempotencyKey = "abc-123";
const result = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8080/restate/invocation/agent/run/${idempotencyKey}/attach`,
  { method: "GET" }
);
await result.json();
```

Consult the [HTTP requests](/services/invocation/http#attach-to-an-invocation) page for more information.
