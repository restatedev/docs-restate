Build resilient AI agents and workflows with Restate's durable execution platform. Restate provides the reliability infrastructure you need to run AI workloads in production - from simple LLM chains to complex multi-agent systems.

## Why Restate?
Restate makes building AI workflows and agent easy:
- ✅ Recovery from failures - Never lose agent progress again
- ✅ Built-in state management - No databases to configure
- ✅ Complete observability - Trace every decision and action
- ✅ Composable patterns - From simple agents to complex multi-agent systems
- ✅ Production safety - Approvals, timeouts, and rollback built-in

Whether you're building chatbots, autonomous agents, or AI-powered workflows, Restate handles the complexity of distributed execution so you can focus on your AI logic.

## AI & Agent SDK Integrations

Get started quickly by integrating Restate with your favorite AI and Agent SDKs. Restate works with most AI SDKs that allow you to wrap model calls and tools, enabling durable execution for your AI workloads.

## Composable AI Patterns

If you prefer to **own your control flow** and only want to use an AI SDK for model calls, Restate's durable execution patterns can be composed together to build complex AI applications.
