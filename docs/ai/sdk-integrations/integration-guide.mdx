Integrating Restate with Agent / AI SDKs usually involves similar patterns


## Agent SDKs vs. AI SDKs

For simplicity, let's make a distinction between the following two types of SDKs:

<img src="/img/ai/sdk-integrations/ai-sdks.png"/>

1. **AI SDKs: those that abstract away LLM calls.** Thses SDKs give you a nice code-defined way of doing the HTTP call. Without all the gnarly request massaging and response parsing you would otherwise need to do. They let you call several model providers with a single unified API. Usually, you can specify the definition of tools, so the LLM might request to execute them, but execution is managed and started by you.
**Examples**: LiteLLM for Python, Vercel AI SDK for TypeScript, LangChain4j / Spring AI for Java
2. **Agent SDKs: Those that abstract away LLM calls and the agent loop.** These SDKs abstract away the LLM calls but also the agent loop. You get a high-level DSL to implement your agents. These definitions are almost more like configuration than code. You specify their name, description, a list of tools they have access to, optionally even other agents they can call. And then SDK then executes and fully controls the loop we described in the previous section. You can only customize execution via configuration, for example disallowing parallel execution of tools.
**Examples**: OpenAI Agents SDK for Python/TypeScript, Vercel AI SDK for TypeScript, LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.

## Integrating AI SDKs
Just wrap the calls to the LLM in run blocks.

You can find examples of this in the patterns for [TypeScript](https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/main/typescript-patterns) and [Python](https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/main/python-patterns).

## Integrating Agent SDKs

Simplest is just to wrap LLM calls and full execution of tools

More tight integration is propagating the Restate context to tools to do fine-grained durable steps in tools.
What you need to do:
- wrap model calls
- Find a way to get your Restate context in your tools
- Raise terminal errors
- Disable parallel processing
- Ensure that the execution is deterministic: watch out for ids/timestamps/randomness
- Optional: use Restate for session state management
