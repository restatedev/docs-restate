What you need to do:
- wrap model calls
- Find a way to get your Restate context in your tools
- Raise terminal errors
- Disable parallel processing
- Ensure that the execution is deterministic: watch out for ids/timestamps/randomness
- Optional: use Restate for session state management


Simplest is just to wrap LLM calls and full execution of tools


More tight integration is propagating the Restate context to tools to do fine-grained durable steps in tools.
