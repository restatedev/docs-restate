This tutorial will guide you through deploying a single-node Restate cluster on a local Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

We will use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create a local Kubernetes cluster for testing purposes.

<Steps>
<Step title={"Prerequisites"}>
    Install the following on your local machine:
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
    - [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
    - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
    - [Restate](/installation)
    - [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start)

    This guide was written with kind v0.30.0, and Restate v1.5.0.
    Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skW3AZ6uGd) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/restatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2v9gl005c-WBpr167o5XJZI1l7HWKImA) if something does not work as expected.
</Step>
<Step title={"Create a kind cluster"}>
    ```bash
    kind create cluster
    ```

    Set `kubectl` context to `kind-kind`:

    ```bash
    kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
    ```
</Step>
<Step title={"Install the single-node Restate Helm chart"}>

    ```bash
    helm install restate oci://ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-helm \
      --namespace restate
      --create-namespace
    ```

    This will deploy a single-node Restate cluster in the `restate` namespace.

    Wait until the `restate-0` pod is in the `Ready` state:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n restate -w
    ```

</Step>

<Step title={"Forward the ports of the Restate ingress and the UI to your local machine"}>
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/restate -n restate 8080:8080 9070:9070
```

Now you can access the Restate UI at `http://localhost:9070`.
</Step>

<Step title={"Build and upload a Restate service Docker image to the kind cluster"}>

For example, download the TypeScript Hello World service:
```bash
restate example typescript-hello-world &&
cd typescript-hello-world &&
npm install
```

Build a Docker image for the service:

```bash
docker build -t my-restate-service:0.0.1 .
```

Upload the image to the kind cluster:

```bash
kind load docker-image my-restate-service:0.0.1
```
</Step>

<Step title={"Deploy the Restate service"}>

Create a `RestateDeployment` manifest for the service in a file called `service-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml service-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: my-restate-service:0.0.1
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 9080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 9080
    targetPort: 9080
```

Apply the manifest to deploy the service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service-deployment.yaml -n restate
```

</Step>

<Step title={"Register the service"}>
In the Restate UI, you can now register the deployment `http://my-app.restate.svc.cluster.local:9080/` via the UI at `http://localhost:9070`.

Once it is registered, you should see the deployed service listed in the Restate UI:

    <img src={"/img/guides/helm-on-kind/registration.png"}/>
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title={"Invoke the service"}>
In the Restate UI playground, you can now invoke the service. In the overview page, click on the `greet` handler of your service to open the playground.
Then send a request:

</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title={"ðŸŽ‰ You did it!"}>
    You have successfully deployed a Restate cluster and a Restate service on a local kind Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart!

    Check out the [Restate Helm deployment docs](/server/deploy/kubernetes#helm-chart) for more information.
</Step>
</Steps>




After you are done experimenting, you can delete the kind cluster:

```bash
kind delete cluster
```
