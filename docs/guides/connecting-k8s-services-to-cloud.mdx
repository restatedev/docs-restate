This guide walks you through connecting Kubernetes services to Restate Cloud with Restate Operator.

We will use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create a local Kubernetes cluster for testing purposes.

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">
    Install the following on your local machine:
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
    - [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
    - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
    - [Restate](/installation)
    - [Restate Cloud account](https://cloud.restate.dev/) (free tier available)
    - [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start)

    This guide was written with kind v0.30.0, [Restate Operator](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-operator/tree/main) v1.8.1, and Restate v1.5.0.
    Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.restate.dev) or [Slack](https://slack.restate.dev) if something does not work as expected.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a Restate Cloud environment">
    Open the [Restate Cloud UI](https://cloud.restate.dev) and create a new environment.

    Note the environment id (`env_...`) and request signing key (under security -> HTTP services: `publickeyv1_...`), as you will need them later.

</Step>
<Step title="Create a kind cluster">
    ```bash
    kind create cluster
    ```

    Set `kubectl` context to `kind-kind`:

    ```bash
    kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
    ```
</Step>
<Step title="Install the Restate Operator">

    <InstallRestateOperator/>

</Step>
<Step title="Create a Restate Cloud environment secret">

    Create an API key via `Developers` tab of the Restate Cloud UI and give it `Full` permissions.

    The API key starts with `api_`. Put it in a file named `token` and add the secret:
    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic my-cloud-environment-secret \
    --from-file=token=./token -n restate-operator
    ```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up a secure tunnel between the kind cluster and Restate Cloud">

Create a `RestateCloudEnvironment` manifest in a file called `restate-cloud-env.yaml`:
```yaml restate-cloud-env.yaml
apiVersion: restate.dev/v1beta1
kind: RestateCloudEnvironment
metadata:
  name: my-cloud-environment
spec:
  environmentId: env_...
  signingPublicKey: publickeyv1_...
  region: eu
  authentication:
    secret:
      name: my-cloud-environment-secret
      key: token
```

- The `environmentId` can be found in the Restate Cloud UI in the top left corner when you select your environment.
This ID starts with `env_`.

- The `signingPublicKey` can be found in the Restate Cloud UI under `Developers`. Scroll down to the `Security` section to find the public key under `HTTP endpoints`.
The public key starts with `publickeyv1_`.

- Set the `region` field to the region your Restate Cloud environment is hosted in. Possible values are `us` and `eu`.
You can find the region next to your environment ID in the Restate Cloud UI.


Finally, apply the manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f restate-cloud-env.yaml
```

This deploys a tunnel service in the `restate-operator` namespace that connects the kind cluster to your Restate Cloud environment.

And wait until the tunnel is ready:
```bash
kubectl get pods -w -n restate-operator
```

</Step>

<Step title="Build and upload a Restate service Docker image to the kind cluster">

For example, download the TypeScript Hello World service:
```bash
restate example typescript-hello-world &&
cd typescript-hello-world &&
npm install
```

Build a Docker image for the service:

```bash
docker build -t my-restate-service:0.0.1 .
```

Upload the image to the kind cluster:

```bash
kind load docker-image my-restate-service:0.0.1
```
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy the Restate service">

Create a `RestateDeployment` manifest for the service in a file called `service-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml service-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: restate.dev/v1beta1
kind: RestateDeployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  restate:
    register:
      cloud: my-cloud-environment
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: my-restate-service:0.0.1
        ports:
        - name: restate
          containerPort: 9080
```

Apply the manifest to deploy the service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service-deployment.yaml -n restate-test
```

You should now see the deployed service listed in the Restate Cloud UI:


<Frame>
<img src={"/img/guides/connecting-k8s-services-to-cloud/registration.png"}/>
</Frame>

The Restate Operator automatically [registered](/services/versioning#registering-a-deployment) the service with the Restate cluster.

</Step>

<Step title="Invoke the service">
In the Restate Cloud UI playground, you can now invoke the service. In the overview page, click on the `greet` handler of your service to open the playground.
Then send a request:

<Frame>
    <img src={"/img/guides/restate-on-kind-with-operator/invoke.png"}/>
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="🎉 You did it!">
    You have successfully connected a Restate service to Restate Cloud!

    Check out the [Restate Cloud docs](/cloud/connecting-services) for further information.
</Step>
</Steps>


After you are done experimenting, you can delete the kind cluster:

```bash
kind delete cluster
```
