## Setting up a tunnel to Restate Cloud

You can connect your services to Restate Cloud via Restate's tunnel client.

### 1. Create a Restate Cloud environment
Open the [Restate Cloud UI](https://cloud.restate.dev) and create a new environment.

Note the environment id (`env_...`) and request signing key (under security -> HTTP services: `publickeyv1_...`), as you will need them later.

Create a "Full" scope API key and copy the key for later.

### 2. Setup the CLI
Next, we need to set up a CLI profile to connect to our Restate Cloud environment.

Log in to Restate Cloud using the CLI:
```bash
restate cloud login
```

Set up a new CLI profile for your environment:
```bash
restate cloud env configure
```

Tell the CLI to use the new environment:
```bash
restate config use-env <name>
```

### 3. Run the tunnel

Run the tunnel in a Docker container. Either locally or next to your service:

```bash
# export RESTATE_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_...
# export RESTATE_BEARER_TOKEN=key_...
# export RESTATE_TUNNEL_NAME=test-tunnel
# export RESTATE_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY=publickeyv1_...
# export RESTATE_CLOUD_REGION=eu
# export RUST_LOG=info

docker run \
  -e RESTATE_CLOUD_REGION \
  -e RESTATE_ENVIRONMENT_ID \
  -e RESTATE_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY \
  -e RESTATE_BEARER_TOKEN \
  -e RESTATE_TUNNEL_NAME \
  -e RUST_LOG \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -it ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-cloud-tunnel-client:0.4.0
```

### 4. Run a Restate service locally

Follow the quickstart to [run a Restate service locally](/quickstart).

### 5. Register your service

If your setup is correct, you can now register your service with the Restate Cloud environment:
```bash
restate deployments register https://tunnel.eu.restate.cloud:9080/<no-prefix-env-id>/<tunnel-name>/http/<remote-fqdn>/<remote-port>
```

- Use just the numeric environment id here (without the `env_` prefix).
- The tunnel name must match the name provided to the tunnel client
- The remote fqdn and port must resolve to the Restate service endpoint (e.g. `localhost:9080`) from the perspective of the tunnel client

For example, if your service is running on `localhost:9080` and your environment id is `env_20d1231jyphzkm8`, you can register it like this:
```bash
restate deployments register https://tunnel.eu.restate.cloud:9080/20d1231jyphzkm8/test-tunnel/http/localhost/9080
```

### 6. Test your service

You can now test your service by invoking it via Restate Cloud.

### How does it work?
- Restate CLI is communicating with your Restate environment at `https://*.eu.restate.cloud:9070` using your user id token and asking the admin API to perform a discovery at the special tunnel URL
- The Restate Cloud end of the tunnel receives the request from your environment and, subject to matching tunnel found, forwarding the traffic to the tunnel container
- The tunnel container is forwarding the traffic to the Restate service endpoint

## AWS Lambda services

To invoke services running on AWS Lambda, Restate Cloud needs to assume an AWS
identity in the same account that the Lambda is deployed to. Create a new role
that has permission to invoke your Lambda handlers, and give it the following
trust policy.

<Info>
    The Restate Cloud role is distinct from the Lambda function's execution role.
    The execution role is assumed by your function to perform its work. A dedicated
    invoker role is needed to grant Restate Cloud permission to invoke service handler
    functions in your account, and nothing more.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```json IAM JSON Policy expandable
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::654654156625:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::654654156625:role/RestateCloud",
                    "sts:ExternalId": "${ENVIRONMENT_ID}"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::654654156625:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:TagSession"
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace the `${ENVIRONMENT_ID}` placeholder with the environment ID can be found in the UI and in the output of `restate whoami`.
This trust policy allows the Restate Cloud `us.restate.cloud` region principal to assume the role, but only on behalf of the specified environment ID.

```ts AWS CDK
const restateCloudRole = new iam.Role(this, "RestateCloudRole", {
    assumedBy: new iam.AccountPrincipal("654654156625")
        .withConditions({
            "StringEquals": {
                "sts:ExternalId": environmentId,
                "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::654654156625:role/RestateCloud",
            },
        }),
});
restateCloudRole.assumeRolePolicy!.addStatements(
    new iam.PolicyStatement({
        principals: [new iam.AccountPrincipal("654654156625")],
        actions: ["sts:TagSession"],
    }),
);
```

        When you use the [Restate CDK construct library](/deploy/services/faas/lambda/cdk) to deploy
        Lambda handlers, the provided invoker role will automatically be granted access
        to invoke the corresponding functions. If you manage Restate service deployments
        some other way, you should ensure that the Restate Cloud invoker role is permitted
        to call the appropriate Lambda handler functions by allowing it to perform `lambda:InvokeFunction`.

        Use the `environmentId` variable to pass the environment ID can be found in the UI and in the output of `restate whoami`.
        This trust policy allows the Restate Cloud `us.restate.cloud` region principal to assume the role, but only on behalf of the specified environment.
</CodeGroup>

You can now register your Lambda through the new role:

```shell
restate deployments register <LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN> --assume-role-arn <ROLE_ARN>
```

If something isn't working, the environment logs in the cloud UI may help
you find the issue.

<Info>
    **Securing your services:**

    If your Lambda has an appropriate trust policy as described above, you do not
need to secure incoming requests any further. If you choose to however, the
identity verification checks will work on Lambda endpoints as well.
</Info>


## Public HTTP endpoint & request signing

Restate invokes your services over the public internet. For production use cases
HTTPS must be used between Restate and your services. You can terminate TLS at
the service endpoint directly, but it's likely easier to use a fronting
load balancer like an AWS NLB.

You must secure access to your service so that only Restate can call it.
The easiest way to do this is with our native request identity feature.
All requests to your service will be signed with a unique environment-specific private
key. You can find the corresponding public key in the environment settings UI, under HTTP Services.
It is safe to include this public key directly in your service code.
