            The number of timers in memory limit is used to bound the amount of timers loaded in memory. If this limit is set, when exceeding it, the timers farther in the future will be spilled to disk.

            In order to clean up completed invocations, that is invocations invoked with an idempotency id, or workflows, Restate periodically scans among the completed invocations to check whether they need to be removed or not. This interval sets the scan interval of the cleanup procedure. Default: 1 hour.

Can be configured using the [`humantime`](https://docs.rs/humantime/latest/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html) format.

                    This timer guards against stalled service/handler invocations. Once it expires, Restate triggers a graceful termination by asking the service invocation to suspend (which preserves intermediate progress).

The 'abort timeout' is used to abort the invocation, in case it doesn't react to the request to suspend.

                    This timer guards against stalled service/handler invocations that are supposed to terminate. The abort timeout is started after the 'inactivity timeout' has expired and the service/handler invocation has been asked to gracefully terminate. Once the timer expires, it will abort the service/handler invocation.

This timer potentially **interrupts** user code. If the user code needs longer to gracefully terminate, then this value needs to be set accordingly.

The number of records bifrost will attempt to prefetch from replicated loglet's log-servers for every loglet reader (e.g. partition processor). Note that this mainly impacts readers that are not co-located with the loglet sequencer (i.e. partition processor followers).

                    Trigger to prefetch more records

When read-ahead is used (readahead-records), this value (percentage in float) will determine when readers should trigger a prefetch for another batch to fill up the buffer. For instance, if this value is 0.3, then bifrost will trigger a prefetch when 30% or more of the read-ahead slots become available (e.g. partition processor consumed records and freed up enough slots).

The higher the value is, the longer bifrost will wait before it triggers the next fetch, potentially fetching more records as a result.

To illustrate, if readahead-records is set to 100 and readahead-trigger-ratio is 1.0. Then bifrost will prefetch up to 100 records from log-servers and will not trigger the next prefetch unless the consumer consumes 100% of this buffer. This means that bifrost will read in batches but will not do while the consumer is still reading the previous batch.

Value must be between 0 and 1. It will be clamped at `1.0`.

    [PREVIEW FEATURE] Setting the location allows Restate to form a tree-like cluster topology. The value is written in the format of `\"<region>[.zone]\"` to assign this node to a specific region, or to a zone within a region.

The value of region and zone is arbitrary but whitespace and `.` are disallowed.

NOTE: It's _strongly_ recommended to not change the node's location string after its initial registration. Changing the location may result in data loss or data inconsistency if `log-server` is enabled on this node.

When this value is not set, the node is considered to be in the _default_ location. The _default_ location means that the node is not assigned to any specific region or zone.

**Examples** - `us-west` -- the node is in the `us-west` region. - `us-west.a1` -- the node is in the `us-west` region and in the `a1` zone. - `` -- [default] the node is in the default location

auto-provision is allowed by default in development mode and is disabled if restate-server runs with `--production` flag to prevent cluster nodes from forming their own clusters, rather than forming a single cluster.

This can also be explicitly disabled by setting this value to false.

    If non-zero, we perform bigger reads when doing compaction. If you're running RocksDB on spinning disks, you should set this to at least 2MB. That way RocksDB's compaction is doing sequential instead of random reads.

<ResponseField name="gossip-tick-interval" type="string" default={"100ms"}>
    The interval at which the failure detector will tick. Decrease this value for faster reaction to node failures. Note, that every tick comes with an overhead.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-failure-threshold" type="integer" default={10}>
    Specifies how many gossip intervals of inactivity need to pass before considering a node as dead.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-num-peers" type="integer" default={2}>
    On every gossip interval, how many peers each node attempts to gossip with. The default is optimized for small clusters (less than 5). On larger clusters, if gossip overhead is noticeable, consider reducing this value to 1.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-fd-stability-threshold" type="integer" default={3}>
    Gossips before failure detector is stable
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-suspect-interval" type="string" default={"5s"}>
    How long to keep a node in a transient state (suspect) before marking it as available. Larger values mean that the cluster is less prone to flaky nodes but extends the time it takes for a node to participate.

A node becomes a suspect if it has been previously marked as dead for a given generation number. If the node incremented its generation number, it will not be impacted by this threshold.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-loneliness-threshold" type="integer" default={30}>
    How many intervals need to pass without receiving any gossip messages before considering this node as potentially isolated/dead. This threshold is used in the case where the node can still send gossip messages but did not receive any. This can rarely happen in asymmetric network partitions.

In this case, the node will advertise itself as dead in the gossip messages it sends out.

Note: this threshold does not apply to a cluster that's configured with a single node.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-extras-exchange-frequency" type="integer" default={10}>
    In addition to basic health/liveness information, the gossip protocol is used to exchange extra information about the roles hosted by this node. For instance, which partitions are currently running, their configuration versions, and the durable LSN of the corresponding partition databases. This information is sent every Nth gossip message. This setting controls the frequency of this exchange. For instance, `10` means that every 10th gossip message will contain the extra information about.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-time-skew-threshold" type="string" default={"1s"}>
    The time skew is the maximum acceptable time difference between the local node and the time reported by peers via gossip messages. The time skew is also used to ignore gossip messages that are too old.
