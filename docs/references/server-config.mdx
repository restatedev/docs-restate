The number of records bifrost will attempt to prefetch from replicated loglet's log-servers for every loglet reader (e.g. partition processor). Note that this mainly impacts readers that are not co-located with the loglet sequencer (i.e. partition processor followers).

                    Trigger to prefetch more records

When read-ahead is used (readahead-records), this value (percentage in float) will determine when readers should trigger a prefetch for another batch to fill up the buffer. For instance, if this value is 0.3, then bifrost will trigger a prefetch when 30% or more of the read-ahead slots become available (e.g. partition processor consumed records and freed up enough slots).

The higher the value is, the longer bifrost will wait before it triggers the next fetch, potentially fetching more records as a result.

To illustrate, if readahead-records is set to 100 and readahead-trigger-ratio is 1.0. Then bifrost will prefetch up to 100 records from log-servers and will not trigger the next prefetch unless the consumer consumes 100% of this buffer. This means that bifrost will read in batches but will not do while the consumer is still reading the previous batch.

Value must be between 0 and 1. It will be clamped at `1.0`.

Use this to limit the size of WAL files. If the size of all WAL files exceeds this limit, the oldest WAL file will be deleted and if needed, memtable flush will be triggered.

Note: RocksDB internally counts the uncompressed bytes to determine the WAL size, and since the WAL is compressed, the actual size on disk will be significantly smaller than this value (~1/4 depending on the compression ratio). For instance, if this is set to \"1 MiB\", then rocksdb might decide to flush if the total WAL (on disk) reached ~260 KiB (compressed).

Default is `0` which translates into 6 times the memory allocated for membtables for this database.

    [PREVIEW FEATURE] Setting the location allows Restate to form a tree-like cluster topology. The value is written in the format of \"region[.zone]\" to assign this node to a specific region, or to a zone within a region.

The value of region and zone is arbitrary but whitespace and `.` are disallowed.

NOTE: It's _strongly_ recommended to not change the node's location string after its initial registration. Changing the location may result in data loss or data inconsistency if `log-server` is enabled on this node.

When this value is not set, the node is considered to be in the _default_ location. The _default_ location means that the node is not assigned to any specific region or zone.

## Examples - `us-west` -- the node is in the `us-west` region. - `us-west.a1` -- the node is in the `us-west` region and in the `a1` zone. - `` -- [default] the node is in the default location

<ResponseField name="gossip-fd-stability-threshold" type="integer" default={3}>
    Gossips before failure detector is stable
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-suspect-interval" type="string" default={"5s"}>
    Duration string in either jiff human friendly or ISO8601 format. Check https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/struct.Span.html#parsing-and-printing for more details.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-loneliness-threshold" type="integer" default={30}>
    How many intervals need to pass without receiving any gossip messages before considering this node as potentially isolated/dead. This threshold is used in the case where the node can still send gossip messages but did not receive any. This can rarely happen in asymmetric network partitions.

In this case, the node will advertise itself as dead in the gossip messages it sends out.

Note: this threshold does not apply to a cluster that's configured with a single node.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-extras-exchange-frequency" type="integer" default={10}>
    In addition to basic health/liveness information, the gossip protocol is used to exchange extra information about the roles hosted by this node. For instance, which partitions are currently running, their configuration versions, and the durable LSN of the corresponding partition databases. This information is sent every Nth gossip message. This setting controls the frequency of this exchange. For instance, `10` means that every 10th gossip message will contain the extra information about.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gossip-time-skew-threshold" type="string" default={"1s"}>
    The time skew is the maximum acceptable time difference between the local node and the time reported by peers via gossip messages. The time skew is also used to ignore gossip messages that are too old.
