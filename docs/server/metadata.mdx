Restate stores cluster configuration data in a dedicated metadata store. This page explains the available metadata backend options, and how to choose and configure the right one for your deployment.

<Info title="Architectural overview">
    To understand the terminology used on this page, it might be helpful to read through the [architecture reference](/references/architecture#metadata-store).
</Info>

## What is Metadata?

Metadata in Restate includes critical cluster coordination information:
- **Cluster membership**: Which nodes are part of the cluster and their roles
- **Partition assignments**: How partitions are distributed across worker nodes
- **Service deployments**: Registered service endpoints and their versions
- **Log configuration**: How the replicated log is configured and which nodes participate

The metadata store is essential for cluster operation. While metadata is updated relatively infrequently, its availability is crucial for cluster health.

<Warning>
    Choose your metadata provider during initial deployment based on your infrastructure and requirements. While migration between providers is possible from replicated to external stores, this operation requires a maintenance window (downtime) and careful execution.
</Warning>

## Metadata Storage Providers

Restate supports four metadata storage providers, each suited to different deployment scenarios:

1. **Replicated** (Default) - Built-in Raft-based consensus metadata server
2. **Etcd** - External etcd cluster integration
3. **Amazon S3** - We strongly recommend against using other S3-compatible stores for metadata

## When to Use Each Provider

### Replicated (Default)

The replicated metadata server uses Raft consensus to provide a highly-available metadata store built directly into Restate nodes.

**Use cases:**
- Standard production deployments
- On-premises or multi-cloud environments
- Deployments where you want minimal external dependencies
- Environments where you already run stateful services

**Requirements:**
- Nodes must run the `metadata-server` role
- Persistent storage for metadata server nodes
- Odd number of metadata-server nodes for quorum (typically 3 or 5)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ No external dependencies - everything runs within Restate
- ✅ Battle-tested Raft consensus for strong consistency
- ✅ Works in any environment (cloud, on-prem, hybrid)
- ⚠️ Needs careful attention to node placement for fault tolerance
- ⚠️ Requires manual provisioning after majority of nodes are up to avoid split brain (other backends safely support auto-provisioning in a multi-node cluster)

### Etcd

Use an external etcd cluster as the metadata store. This is ideal if you already operate etcd infrastructure or prefer to centralize metadata management.

**Use cases:**
- Organizations with existing etcd infrastructure
- Environments with dedicated etcd operations expertise
- Multi-tenant deployments with centralized control

**Requirements:**
- External etcd cluster (v3.x) must be available
- Network connectivity between Restate nodes and etcd
- etcd cluster properly configured for production use

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Leverage existing etcd infrastructure
- ✅ Separate metadata concerns from Restate node management
- ✅ Allows sharing metadata across clusters
- ⚠️ Adds external dependency that must be separately managed
- ⚠️ Network latency to etcd can affect cluster operations
- ⚠️ Requires etcd operations expertise

### Object Store (Amazon S3)

Use Amazon S3 as a metadata store. This provides a lightweight alternative to running metadata servers while keeping all data in object storage.

**Use cases:**
- AWS deployments with existing S3 infrastructure
- Minimizing stateful components
- Environments optimizing for S3 as primary storage

**Requirements:**
- Amazon S3 bucket (not S3-compatible alternatives)
- IAM permissions for S3 operations
- Very low-latency access to S3 (same region recommended)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ No metadata servers to manage
- ✅ Integrates with existing S3 buckets
- ✅ Simple backup and recovery
- ⚠️ **Only Amazon S3 is tested and supported** (notably, MinIO is not supported for metadata)
- ⚠️ Tied to a single region!
- ⚠️ Network latency to S3 directly affects cluster operations
- ⚠️ Must ensure very low-latency access (typically same region)

<Warning>
    For object store metadata: Only Amazon S3 is currently tested and supported. Using S3-compatible alternatives is not supported and may lead to correctness issues. MinIO in particular is known to be incompatible as a metadata backend.
</Warning>

## Configuration Examples

### Replicated (Default)

This is the default configuration for multi-node clusters. Each node needs to know about all metadata server addresses.

```toml restate.toml
# Node configuration - each node needs these settings
node-name = "node-1"
cluster-name = "my-cluster"

# Enable the metadata-server role on this node
roles = [
    "metadata-server",
    "worker",
    "log-server",
    "admin",
    "http-ingress"
]

# List all metadata server nodes (all nodes need this)
[metadata-client]
type = "replicated"
addresses = [
    "http://node-1:5122/",
    "http://node-2:5122/",
    "http://node-3:5122/"
]
```

<Info>
    For fault tolerance, run metadata-server on an odd number of nodes (typically 3 or 5). To tolerate `n` node failures, you need at least `2n + 1` metadata server nodes.
</Info>

### Etcd

Configure Restate to use an external etcd cluster:

```toml restate.toml
# No metadata-server role needed
roles = [
    "worker",
    "log-server",
    "admin",
    "http-ingress"
]

[metadata-client]
type = "etcd"
# Etcd cluster addresses (host:port format)
addresses = [
    "etcd-1.example.com:2379",
    "etcd-2.example.com:2379",
    "etcd-3.example.com:2379"
]

# Optional: Adjust timeouts if needed
connect-timeout = "5s"
keep-alive-interval = "10s"
```

### Object Store (Amazon S3)

Configure Restate to use Amazon S3 for metadata storage:

```toml restate.toml
# No metadata-server role needed
roles = [
    "worker",
    "log-server",
    "admin",
    "http-ingress"
]

[metadata-client]
type = "object-store"
# S3 bucket and optional prefix
path = "s3://restate-metadata-bucket/cluster-prod"

# Authentication options
aws-profile = "my-profile"
# Or use explicit credentials:
# aws-access-key-id = "..."
# aws-secret-access-key = "..."
# aws-session-token = "..."

aws-region = "us-east-1"

# Optional: For testing with local S3-compatible storage
# aws-endpoint-url = "http://localhost:9000"
# aws-allow-http = true
```

<Warning>
    Object store metadata requires low-latency access to S3. Deploy your Restate cluster in the same AWS region as your S3 bucket to minimize latency impact on cluster operations.
</Warning>

## Migrating Between Providers

Restate supports migrating metadata from the replicated provider to external providers (etcd, or object-store) using the `restatectl metadata migrate` command. This allows you to change metadata providers without losing cluster state.

<Warning>
    **Important limitations:**
    - Migration only supports moving FROM replicated TO external providers (not the reverse)
    - Migration requires all cluster nodes to be restarted in migration mode
    - Plan for a maintenance window as the cluster will not process invocations during migration
</Warning>

### Migration Process

#### Prerequisites

Before starting the migration:

1. **Target metadata store must be accessible and ready:**
   - Etcd: Cluster running and accessible
   - Object Store: S3 bucket created and accessible

2. **Prepare target configuration:**
   - Have your target `[metadata-client]` configuration ready in TOML format
   - Test connectivity from Restate nodes to the target store

3. **Plan for downtime:**
   - All nodes will need to be restarted in migration mode
   - Invocation processing will be paused during migration

#### Step-by-Step Migration

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare target metadata store">

For Etcd:
```bash
# Ensure your etcd cluster is running and accessible
etcdctl endpoint health
```

For Object Store:
```bash
# Ensure S3 bucket exists and is accessible
aws s3 ls s3://restate-metadata-bucket/
```

</Step>

<Step title="Restart all nodes in migration mode">

Stop all cluster nodes and restart them with the `--metadata-migration-mode` flag:

```bash
restate --metadata-migration-mode --config-file restate.toml
```

<Info>
    In migration mode, only the Admin and MetadataServer roles are active. The cluster will not process invocations or serve requests until migration is complete and nodes are restarted normally.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Create target configuration file">

Create a TOML file (e.g., `target-metadata.toml`) with your target metadata client configuration:

**For Etcd:**
```toml target-metadata.toml
[metadata-client]
type = "etcd"
addresses = [
    "etcd-1.example.com:2379",
    "etcd-2.example.com:2379",
    "etcd-3.example.com:2379"
]
```

**For Object Store:**
```toml target-metadata.toml
[metadata-client]
type = "object-store"
path = "s3://restate-metadata-bucket/cluster-prod"
aws-profile = "my-profile"
aws-region = "us-east-1"
```

</Step>

<Step title="Run migration command">

Execute the migration using `restatectl`:

```bash
restatectl metadata migrate --toml target-metadata.toml
```

By default, the migration will fail if any keys already exist in the target store. To override existing keys:

```bash
restatectl metadata migrate --toml target-metadata.toml --force
```

<Warning>
    Use `--force` with caution. It will overwrite any existing metadata in the target store, which could cause issues if the target is shared with other clusters.
</Warning>

The migration command will:
1. Read all metadata from the replicated store
2. Write it to the target store
3. Verify the migration succeeded
4. Display next steps

Expected output:
```
✅ Metadata migration completed

1. Please make sure to update all nodes config with
   [metadata-client]
   type = "etcd"
   addresses = [
       "etcd-1.example.com:2379",
       "etcd-2.example.com:2379",
       "etcd-3.example.com:2379"
   ]

2. Restart all nodes without the --metadata-migration-mode
```

</Step>

<Step title="Update node configurations">

Update the `[metadata-client]` section in all node configuration files with the target configuration:

```toml restate.toml
# Remove or comment out metadata-server role if present
roles = [
    "worker",
    "log-server",
    "admin",
    "http-ingress"
]

# Replace [metadata-client] section with target configuration
[metadata-client]
type = "etcd"
addresses = [
    "etcd-1.example.com:2379",
    "etcd-2.example.com:2379",
    "etcd-3.example.com:2379"
]
```

Also remove or comment out the `[metadata-server]` section if present, as it's no longer needed with external metadata providers.

</Step>

<Step title="Restart all nodes normally">

Stop all nodes running in migration mode and restart them with their updated configurations:

```bash
restate --config-file restate.toml
```

Verify the cluster is healthy:

```bash
restatectl status
restatectl nodes list
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting Migration

**Migration fails with "target keys exist":**
- The target store already contains metadata keys
- Either use `--force` to override, or clean the target store first
- Verify you're not accidentally sharing a metadata store with another cluster

**Migration command times out:**
- Check that nodes are actually running in migration mode
- Verify network connectivity to both source and target stores
- Check Restate server logs for errors

**Cluster won't start after migration:**
- Verify all nodes have the updated `[metadata-client]` configuration
- Verify etcd cluster is accessible if using etcd
- Check server logs for connection errors
