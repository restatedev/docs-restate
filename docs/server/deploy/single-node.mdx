title: "Single-Node Deployment"
---

Restate is a single self-contained binary. No external dependencies needed.

You can deploy Restate in a single-node configuration.

What you get:
- full durability
- scaling vertically

What you don't get:
- high availability
- scaling out horizontally

Look at the cluster docs for more info on how to deploy a cluster

## Requirements for deploying Restate
- ability to run a Docker container
- ability to attach a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage

## A quick overview of the single-node architecture

Two ways of running Restate
- persistent volume
- S3-compatible storage

[DIAGRAM]


## Kubernetes
visit the [Kubernetes deployment docs](/server/deploy/kubernetes) for details on how to deploy Restate on Kubernetes.

## AWS

## Azure


## GCP



## Using a persistent volume

- You run a single Restate container
- All data gets stored in `restate-data`
- Attach a persistent volume (EBS, EFS). Your durability is equal to the durability of the underlying storage.
- Restate persists every journal entry if it's in single node mode? Does this increase latency?

Example of the configuration file

## Using S3-compatible storage
- E.g. MinIO, AWS S3, anything else?
- On AWS use S3. Everywhere else minio?
- GCS's S3-compatible API does not support the S3 conditional put semantics we require for both snapshots and metadata store usage. This requires native support, will have an update for you soon.
- Azure: use Minio
- You run a single Restate container
- All data gets stored in S3
- You still need persistent volume? otherwise too slow to wait on S3 writes?
