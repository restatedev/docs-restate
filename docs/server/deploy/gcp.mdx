<Info>
    GCS's S3-compatible API does not support the S3 conditional put semantics we require for both snapshots and metadata store usage.

    We have a first iteration of native GCS support ready and are looking to test it together with you. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skW3AZ6uGd) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/restatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2v9gl005c-WBpr167o5XJZI1l7HWKImA) if you'd like to try it!

## Compute
The easiest way to manage Restate is via the Kubernetes operator.
You can deploy Restate on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using the provided Restate Operator.

## Persistent volumes
You can run a single-node Restate cluster on GKE with persistent volumes.

Running a cluster with persistent volumes and without blob storage snapshots is highly discouraged (partition processors that move to other nodes might not be able to rebuild state and will get stuck).

## Object storage snapshots
Running a cluster without object storage snapshots is highly discouraged (partition processors that move to other nodes might not be able to rebuild state and will get stuck).

We do not yet support GCS as a snapshot repository (actively worked on).

As there is no S3-compatible store, for now, you would need to run Minio in kubernetes to store your snapshots.

A workaround, is running Minio on top of your AKS-cluster.
Only use Minio for snapshots. Not for metadata. Minio's consistency model might lead to corrupt metadata.
