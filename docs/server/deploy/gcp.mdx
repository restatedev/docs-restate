<Info>
GCS's S3-compatible API does not support the S3 conditional put semantics we require for both snapshots and metadata store usage.

We have a first iteration of native GCS support ready and are looking to test it together with you. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skW3AZ6uGd) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/restatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2v9gl005c-WBpr167o5XJZI1l7HWKImA) if you'd like to try it!

## Compute

The easiest way to manage Restate is via the [Kubernetes operator](/server/deploy/kubernetes).
You can deploy Restate on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) using the Restate Operator.

## Persistent volumes

For single node deployments, we recommend using GKE with persistent volumes backing Restate's state store.

For clusters, using persistent volumes is still recommended to speed up failover, but not strictly required.

## Object storage for snapshots
Running a cluster without object storage snapshots is highly discouraged. Partition processors that move to other nodes might not be able to rebuild state and will get stuck.

We do not yet support GCS as a snapshot repository (actively being worked on).

Since there is no S3-compatible store on GCP, you need to run MinIO in Kubernetes to store your snapshots.

<Warning>
Only use MinIO for snapshots, not for metadata. MinIO's consistency model might lead to corrupt metadata, breaking your Restate cluster.

More information on setting up MinIO can be found in the [Kubernetes deployment docs]([see Kubernetes docs](/server/deploy/kubernetes#minio-object-storage).
