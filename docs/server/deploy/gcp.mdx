## Compute

The easiest way to manage Restate is via the [Kubernetes operator](/server/deploy/kubernetes).
You can deploy Restate on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) using the Restate Operator.

## Persistent volumes

For single node deployments, we recommend using GKE with persistent volumes backing Restate's state store.

For clusters, using persistent volumes is still recommended to speed up failover, but not strictly required.

## Object storage for snapshots

Running a cluster without object storage snapshots is highly discouraged. Partition processors that move to other nodes might not be able to rebuild state and will get stuck.

Restate supports Google Cloud Storage natively as a snapshot repository. Configure your snapshot destination using the `gs://` URL scheme:

```toml
[worker.snapshots]
destination = "gs://bucket/prefix"
```

Credentials are discovered automatically via [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials). You can also set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` to use a specific service account JSON file.

For local development, you can use [fake-gcs-server](https://github.com/fsouza/fake-gcs-server) as an emulator.

See the [Snapshots documentation](/server/snapshots) for more details on configuring snapshot intervals, retention, and log trimming.
