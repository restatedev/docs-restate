    We are actively working on native Azure support are looking to test it together with you. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skW3AZ6uGd) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/restatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2v9gl005c-WBpr167o5XJZI1l7HWKImA) if you're interested!

## Compute
You can deploy Restate on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the provided Restate Operator.

## Storage
### Using persistent volumes
You can run a single-node Restate cluster on AKS with persistent volumes.

For clusters, you need a snapshot repository.

### Using blob storage

We do not yet support Azure Blob Storage as a snapshot repository.

As there is no S3-compatible store, you would need to run Minio in kubernetes to store your snapshots.
Running a cluster without blob storage snapshots is highly discouraged (partition processors that move to other nodes might not be able to rebuild state and will get stuck).


A workaround, is running Minio on top of your AKS-cluster.
Only use Minio for snapshots. Not for metadata. Minio's consistency model might lead to corrupt metadata.

## Load balancing

We recommend using the cloud-native load balancer.
