<Info>
For snapshots, we are actively working on native Azure Blob Storage support and are looking to test it together with you. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skW3AZ6uGd) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/restatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2v9gl005c-WBpr167o5XJZI1l7HWKImA) if you're interested!

## Compute

The easiest way to manage Restate is via the [Kubernetes operator](/server/deploy/kubernetes).
You can deploy Restate on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) using the Restate Operator.

## Storage

### Persistent volumes

For single node deployments, we recommend using Azure Managed Disk as the persistent volume backing Restate's state store.

For clusters, using persistent volumes is still recommended to speed up failover, but not strictly required.

### Object storage for snapshots

Running a cluster without object storage snapshots is highly discouraged. Partition processors that move to other nodes might not be able to rebuild state and will get stuck.

We do not yet support Azure Blob Storage as a snapshot repository.

Since there is no S3-compatible store on Azure, you need to run MinIO in AKS to store your snapshots.

<Warning>
Only use MinIO for snapshots, not for metadata. MinIO's consistency model might lead to corrupt metadata, breaking your Restate cluster.

More information on setting up MinIO can be found in the [Kubernetes deployment docs]([see Kubernetes docs](/server/deploy/kubernetes#minio-object-storage).
