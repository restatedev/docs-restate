    We are actively working on native Azure support are looking to test it together with you. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skW3AZ6uGd) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/restatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2v9gl005c-WBpr167o5XJZI1l7HWKImA) if you're interested!

## Compute
You can deploy Restate on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the provided Restate Operator.

## Persistent volumes
You can run a single-node Restate cluster on AKS with persistent volumes.

For clusters, you need a snapshot repository.

## Object storage snapshots

We do not yet support Azure Blob Storage as a snapshot repository.

As there is no S3-compatible store, you would need to run Minio in AKS to store your snapshots.
Only use Minio for snapshots. Not for metadata. Minio's consistency model might lead to corrupt metadata.

Running a cluster without object storage snapshots is highly discouraged, since partition processors that move to other nodes might not be able to rebuild state and will get stuck.
