This page describes how to run the Restate Server in Docker.

## Single-node Restate Server

To run a single-node Restate server using Docker, you can use the following command.

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name restate \
  --rm \  # Remove the named container on stop
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 9070:9070 \
  -p 5122:5122 \
  -v ./restate_data:/restate-data \ # Persist data in the current directory on the host machine
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  docker.restate.dev/restatedev/restate:latest \
  --node-name="restate-1" # Makes sure to restore from restate_data/restate-1 on restart
```

This command starts a Restate server container named `restate` in detached mode.
It maps the necessary ports for ingress, admin, and node-to-node communication.
It also mounts a volume from the host machine to persist the Restate data across container restarts.

The `--node-name` flag ensures that the server uses a consistent node name, which is important for data restoration.
When restate starts, it will look in the `restate-data` directory for a folder with its node name as name, and uses that data.
For example, if node A tried to start on a new node with node_name `node-a` and it finds a `restate-data` directory containing data for `node-b`, then this situation will lead to data loss!
