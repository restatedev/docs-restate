This page describes how to deploy the Restate Server on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Helm Chart
The recommended Kubernetes deployment strategy is a one-replica StatefulSet. We recommend installing Restate in its own
namespace. The easiest way to do this is with our [Helm chart](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/tree/main/charts/restate-helm):

```shell
helm install restate oci://ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-helm --namespace restate --create-namespace
```

## Restate Kubernetes Operator

If you want to run multiple Restate clusters in Kubernetes, or want advanced functionality like managing versions of Restate SDK services, you can also use the [Restate Operator](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-operator). Details
of how to install it and deploy a cluster can be found in the [README](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-operator/blob/main/README.md).



## Helm chart

- Just a configuration file on how you can deploy Restate to Kubernetes.
- You install helm in your kubernetes. Then you install the helm chart. It helps you deploy other peoples manifests to your kubernetes cluster
- you install the CRD which is the schema of the resources that are needed
- our standard helm chart does not require anything extra outside of what is standardly provided by Kubernetes: containers and the ability to attach volumes to those containers
- to make changes you need to do that manually

## Restate Operator

- Completely separate to the helm chart
- Makes available a new resource type called resource cluster and restate deployment
- cluster: more dynamic way of deploying a restate server with volumes etc.
- more abstracted version of deploying a restate server.
- you have less to think about doing things. The operator does some things a bit smarter for you. There is a rust reconciler that looks at the crd that the user deploys and turns that into the resources.
- you need to be an administrator to install it. you must be able to create namespaces and crds etc.
- each restate cluster is deployed in its own namespace
- the operator gets notified whenever the user deploys a crd which includes restate resources.
- the better choice if you have an operations team that deploys the operator. And then the separate teams that want to use Restate can deploy clusters in a slightly higher level way.

### Restate operator service deployment versioning

Restate operator manages multiple deployed versions of services:

- it creates a restatedeployment operator type
- a kubernetes deployment is a scalable deployment that sits behind a service
- a kubernetes service is a named ingress point in front of some computing service that accepts inbound requests. It’s an abstraction over a load balancer that routes traffic to one or more pods.
- a restate deployment is pretty similar to that. It has a named entry point and a container reference. A compute specification template that says how much cpu, memory etc. And since it’s a stateless service it can scale without worrying about persistent volumes
- You can manage multiple versions of the deployment running over time.
- You can give it a specific version and it will deploy that and register it with a restate cluster by specifying a name and a namespace.
- The restate operator will repeatedly check for older versions whether they are drained and will then scales to zero when it sees there are no more ongoing invocations
