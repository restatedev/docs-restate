This page describes how to deploy the Restate Server on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Helm Chart
The recommended Kubernetes deployment strategy is a one-replica StatefulSet. We recommend installing Restate in its own
namespace. The easiest way to do this is with our [Helm chart](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/tree/main/charts/restate-helm):

```shell
helm install restate oci://ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-helm --namespace restate --create-namespace
```

- Just a configuration file on how you can deploy Restate to Kubernetes.
- You install helm in your kubernetes. Then you install the helm chart. It helps you deploy other peoples manifests to your kubernetes cluster
- you install the CRD which is the schema of the resources that are needed
- our standard helm chart does not require anything extra outside of what is standardly provided by Kubernetes: containers and the ability to attach volumes to those containers
- to make changes you need to do that manually

Single node or cluster

## Restate Kubernetes Operator

If you want to run multiple Restate clusters in Kubernetes, or want advanced functionality like managing versions of Restate SDK services, you can also use the [Restate Operator](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-operator). Details
of how to install it and deploy a cluster can be found in the [README](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-operator/blob/main/README.md).


- Completely separate to the helm chart
- Makes available a new resource type called resource cluster and restate deployment
- cluster: more dynamic way of deploying a restate server with volumes etc.
- more abstracted version of deploying a restate server.
- you have less to think about doing things. The operator does some things a bit smarter for you. There is a rust reconciler that looks at the crd that the user deploys and turns that into the resources.
- you need to be an administrator to install it. you must be able to create namespaces and crds etc.
- each restate cluster is deployed in its own namespace
- the operator gets notified whenever the user deploys a crd which includes restate resources.
- the better choice if you have an operations team that deploys the operator. And then the separate teams that want to use Restate can deploy clusters in a slightly higher level way.

### How Restate Operator works together with service versioning

Restate operator manages multiple deployed versions of services:

- it creates a restatedeployment operator type
- a kubernetes deployment is a scalable deployment that sits behind a service
- a kubernetes service is a named ingress point in front of some computing service that accepts inbound requests. It’s an abstraction over a load balancer that routes traffic to one or more pods.
- a restate deployment is pretty similar to that. It has a named entry point and a container reference. A compute specification template that says how much cpu, memory etc. And since it’s a stateless service it can scale without worrying about persistent volumes
- You can manage multiple versions of the deployment running over time.
- You can give it a specific version and it will deploy that and register it with a restate cluster by specifying a name and a namespace.
- The restate operator will repeatedly check for older versions whether they are drained and will then scales to zero when it sees there are no more ongoing invocations

## Setting up a Kind Cluster

### Step 1: Create a Kind Configuration File

Create a file named `kind-config.yaml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
name: restate-cluster
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    # Port mappings to expose services
    extraPortMappings:
      # Restate ingress port
      - containerPort: 30080
        hostPort: 8080
        protocol: TCP
      # Restate admin port
      - containerPort: 30070
        hostPort: 9070
        protocol: TCP
      # Restate NodeCtl port (metrics)
      - containerPort: 30122
        hostPort: 5122
        protocol: TCP
    # Extra mounts for persistence (optional)
    extraMounts:
      - hostPath: ./restate-data
        containerPath: /var/restate-data
```

### Step 2: Create the Kind Cluster

```bash
# Create the cluster with the configuration
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml

# Verify cluster is running
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-restate-cluster

# Check nodes are ready
kubectl get nodes
```

## Installing Restate with Helm

### Step 1: Create a Custom Values File

Create a file named `restate-values.yaml` to configure Restate for single-node operation:

```yaml
# Restate Helm Chart Values for Single-Node Deployment

# StatefulSet configuration
replicaCount: 1

# Service configuration
service:
  type: NodePort
  ingress:
    port: 8080
    nodePort: 30080
  admin:
    port: 9070
    nodePort: 30070
  metrics:
    port: 5122
    nodePort: 30122

# Persistence configuration
persistence:
  enabled: true
  size: 10Gi
  storageClassName: standard
  # For kind, we use the default storage class

# Resource limits and requests
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: "2000m"

# Restate server configuration
config:
  # Single-node configuration
  cluster-name: "restate-single-node"
  node-name: "restate-0"

  # Replication factor for single node
  default-replication: 1

  # Auto-provision the cluster
  auto-provision: true

  # Number of partitions (can be adjusted based on workload)
  bootstrap-num-partitions: 4

  # Bifrost configuration for single node
  bifrost:
    default-provider: "replicated"

  # Metadata server configuration
  metadata-server:
    type: "replicated"

  # Admin server configuration
  admin:
    bind-address: "0.0.0.0:9070"

  # Ingress configuration
  ingress:
    bind-address: "0.0.0.0:8080"

# Service Account
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  name: restate

# Security Context
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  fsGroup: 1000

# Liveness and Readiness Probes
livenessProbe:
  enabled: true
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: admin
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  enabled: true
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: admin
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5

# Optional: Enable ingress if you have an ingress controller
ingress:
  enabled: false
  className: ""
  annotations: {}
  hosts:
    - host: restate.local
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
```

### Step 2: Install Restate Using Helm

```bash
# Create a namespace for Restate
kubectl create namespace restate

# Add the Restate Helm repository (if using OCI registry)
# Note: Restate uses OCI registry for Helm charts

# Install Restate with custom values
helm install restate \
  oci://ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-helm \
  --namespace restate \
  --values restate-values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 5m

# Alternatively, if you've cloned the repository:
# git clone https://github.com/restatedev/restate.git
# cd restate/charts/restate-helm
# helm install restate . --namespace restate --values ../../restate-values.yaml
```

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

```bash
# Check if the StatefulSet is running
kubectl get statefulset -n restate

# Check if the pod is running
kubectl get pods -n restate

# Check services
kubectl get svc -n restate

# View logs
kubectl logs -n restate restate-0

# Check PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)
kubectl get pvc -n restate
```

## Verifying the Installation

### Step 1: Port Forward to Access Restate UI

If NodePort is not working, you can use port-forward:

```bash
# Forward admin port
kubectl port-forward -n restate svc/restate 9070:9070 &

# Forward ingress port
kubectl port-forward -n restate svc/restate 8080:8080 &
```

### Step 2: Check Restate Status

Using the Restate CLI:

```bash
# Check cluster status
restate status

# Or using restatectl from inside the pod
kubectl exec -n restate restate-0 -- restatectl status

# Check nodes
kubectl exec -n restate restate-0 -- restatectl nodes list

# Check logs configuration
kubectl exec -n restate restate-0 -- restatectl logs list
```

### Step 3: Access Restate UI

Open your browser and navigate to:
- Admin UI: http://localhost:9070
- Ingress endpoint: http://localhost:8080

## Deploying a Sample Service

### Step 1: Create a Simple Greeter Service

Create a file named `greeter-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: greeter-service
  namespace: restate
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: greeter
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: greeter
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: greeter
          # Use your own service image or a sample from Restate examples
          image: ghcr.io/restatedev/examples-typescript-greeter:latest
          env:
            - name: PORT
              value: "9080"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9080
              name: restate
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: greeter-service
  namespace: restate
spec:
  selector:
    app: greeter
  ports:
    - port: 9080
      name: restate
  type: ClusterIP
```

Deploy the service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f greeter-deployment.yaml

# Verify the service is running
kubectl get pods -n restate | grep greeter
kubectl get svc -n restate | grep greeter
```

### Step 2: Register the Service with Restate

```bash
# Register the service endpoint
restate deployments register http://greeter-service.restate.svc.cluster.local:9080 \
  --yes

# Or using curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:9070/deployments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"uri": "http://greeter-service.restate.svc.cluster.local:9080"}'

# List registered deployments
restate deployments list
```

## Testing Your Setup

### Step 1: Invoke the Service

```bash
# Call the greeter service
curl http://localhost:8080/Greeter/greet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"World"'

# Expected response: "Hello, World!"
```

### Step 2: Check Service Invocations

```bash
# List invocations
restate invocations list

# Get invocation details (replace with actual invocation ID)
restate invocations describe <invocation-id>
```

## Monitoring and Operations

### Metrics with Prometheus

Restate exposes metrics in Prometheus format at the NodeCtl endpoint:

```bash
# Get metrics
curl http://localhost:5122/metrics
```

### Setting up Prometheus (Optional)

Create `prometheus-config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
  namespace: restate
data:
  prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'restate'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['restate:5122']
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: restate
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: prometheus
          image: prom/prometheus:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9090
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config
              mountPath: /etc/prometheus
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: prometheus-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: restate
spec:
  selector:
    app: prometheus
  ports:
    - port: 9090
  type: NodePort
```

Deploy Prometheus:

```bash
kubectl apply -f prometheus-config.yaml

# Port forward to access Prometheus
kubectl port-forward -n restate svc/prometheus 9090:9090
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Pod Not Starting

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl describe pod -n restate restate-0

# Check logs
kubectl logs -n restate restate-0

# Check events
kubectl get events -n restate --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

#### 2. Service Registration Fails

```bash
# Check if service is reachable from Restate pod
kubectl exec -n restate restate-0 -- curl http://greeter-service:9080

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints -n restate greeter-service
```

#### 3. Storage Issues

```bash
# Check PVC status
kubectl get pvc -n restate

# Check available storage
kubectl get storageclass
kubectl describe storageclass standard
```

#### 4. Connection Issues

```bash
# Test connectivity
kubectl exec -n restate restate-0 -- nc -zv greeter-service 9080

# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies -n restate
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# Stream logs
kubectl logs -n restate restate-0 -f

# Get logs with timestamps
kubectl logs -n restate restate-0 --timestamps=true

# Get previous container logs (if crashed)
kubectl logs -n restate restate-0 --previous
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Scaling to Multi-Node (Future)

While this tutorial focuses on single-node deployment, Restate supports multi-node clusters. To scale:

1. Update the `replicaCount` in your Helm values
2. Configure proper replication factors
3. Set up a shared storage solution
4. Configure snapshot repository for state replication

### 2. Production Considerations

For production deployments, consider:

- **Persistence**: Use production-grade storage classes
- **Snapshots**: Configure external object storage (S3, MinIO)
- **Security**: Enable TLS, configure RBAC
- **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- **Backup**: Implement backup strategies for state data

### 3. Advanced Configuration

Explore additional Restate features:

- **Workflows**: Build complex orchestration workflows
- **Virtual Objects**: Manage stateful entities
- **Kafka Integration**: Connect with event streams
- **Service Versioning**: Implement zero-downtime deployments

### 4. Useful Resources

- [Restate Documentation](https://docs.restate.dev)
- [Restate GitHub Repository](https://github.com/restatedev/restate)
- [Restate Examples](https://github.com/restatedev/examples)
- [Restate Discord Community](https://discord.gg/restate)

## Cleanup

To remove the entire setup:

```bash
# Delete Restate deployment
helm uninstall restate -n restate

# Delete the namespace
kubectl delete namespace restate

# Delete the kind cluster
kind delete cluster --name restate-cluster

# Clean up local data (if created)
rm -rf ./restate-data
```

## Conclusion

You've successfully deployed a single-node Restate cluster on a kind Kubernetes cluster using Helm! This setup provides a solid foundation for:

- Local development and testing
- Learning Restate concepts
- Prototyping distributed applications
- Preparing for production deployments

The single-node configuration is perfect for development but can be easily scaled to multi-node deployments when needed. Restate's architecture ensures that even a single-node deployment provides durable execution and reliable state management for your services.

Remember that Restate handles:
- **Durable execution**: Automatic retries and recovery from failures
- **State management**: Built-in K/V store for your services
- **Service orchestration**: Workflows and virtual objects
- **Version management**: Safe deployments with the Kubernetes operator

Happy building with Restate! 🚀
