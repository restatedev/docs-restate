This page describes how to deploy the Restate Server on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Restate Kubernetes Operator

We recommend running Restate with the [Restate Operator](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-operator).
The operator simplifies deploying and managing Restate clusters and services on Kubernetes.

We recommend using the Restate Operator in combination with a managed Kubernetes provider, such as AWS EKS, Azure's AKS, or Google's GKE.
This eases the management of compute instances and persistent volumes. See the deployment guides for [AWS](/server/deploy/aws), [GCP](/server/deploy/gcp), and [Azure](/server/deploy/azure).

### Features
- Resource types to deploy and manage Restate clusters and services
- Automatic service versioning and scaling down old versions
- Connect Restate deployments running on Kubernetes to Restate Cloud Environments

### Custom Resource Definitions

The Restate Operator introduces Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to Kubernetes to deploy Restate clusters and services.



#### `RestateCluster`


#### `RestateDeployment`

#### `RestateCloudEnvironment`



- Makes available a new resource type called resource cluster and restate deployment
- cluster: more dynamic way of deploying a restate server with volumes etc.
- more abstracted version of deploying a restate server.
- you have less to think about doing things. The operator does some things a bit smarter for you. There is a rust reconciler that looks at the crd that the user deploys and turns that into the resources.
- you need to be an administrator to install it. you must be able to create namespaces and crds etc.
- each restate cluster is deployed in its own namespace
- the operator gets notified whenever the user deploys a crd which includes restate resources.
- the better choice if you have an operations team that deploys the operator. And then the separate teams that want to use Restate can deploy clusters in a slightly higher level way.

### Automatic service versioning

Restate operator manages multiple deployed versions of services:

- it creates a restatedeployment operator type
- a kubernetes deployment is a scalable deployment that sits behind a service
- a kubernetes service is a named ingress point in front of some computing service that accepts inbound requests. It’s an abstraction over a load balancer that routes traffic to one or more pods.
- a restate deployment is pretty similar to that. It has a named entry point and a container reference. A compute specification template that says how much cpu, memory etc. And since it’s a stateless service it can scale without worrying about persistent volumes
- You can manage multiple versions of the deployment running over time.
- You can give it a specific version and it will deploy that and register it with a restate cluster by specifying a name and a namespace.
- The restate operator will repeatedly check for older versions whether they are drained and will then scales to zero when it sees there are no more ongoing invocations

## Helm Chart

For a more bare-bone deployment of a Restate cluster, you can use the [Helm chart](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/tree/main/charts/restate-helm).
This will require you to do more manual operational tasks, such as registration and versioning of services.

The Helm chart does not require anything besides standard Kubernetes functionality: the ability to deploy containers and attach volumes to them.
Any changes to the deployment need to be done manually by updating the Helm chart values and redeploying.

The Helm chart deploys Restate as a one-replica StatefulSet in its own namespace. To install the helm chart:

```shell
helm install restate oci://ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-helm --namespace restate --create-namespace
```

Single node or cluster
