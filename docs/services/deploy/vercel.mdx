Deploy your Restate services on Vercel.
This guide covers project configuration, service registration, and security setup.

## Getting started

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="New project">
        Start from the [vercel-template](https://github.com/restatedev/vercel-template).

        <Card
            title="Create your Restate + Vercel repository"
            icon="github"
            href="https://github.com/new?template_name=vercel-template&template_owner=restatedev"
            arrow="true"
            horizontal
        />
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Existing Next.js project">
        Create a `fetch` endpoint, providing the services:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/examples/refs/heads/main/typescript/templates/vercel/src/restate/serve.ts"}
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk/fetch";
import { greeter } from "@/restate/greeter";

// Create the Restate endpoint. 
// Here you need to register your services
const endpoint = restate.createEndpointHandler({ services: [greeter] });

// Adapt it to Next.js route handlers
export const serve = () => {
  return {
    POST: (req: Request) => endpoint(req),
    GET: (req: Request) => endpoint(req),
  };
};
```

        And expose the endpoint in a Next.js parameterized route, e.g. `/restate/[[...services]]`:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/examples/refs/heads/main/typescript/templates/vercel/src/app/restate/%5B%5B...services%5D%5D/route.ts"}
import { serve } from "@/restate/serve";

// This is the route that exposes the Restate services.
// You can register it to Restate using /restate subpath (check the README)
// To call it, open Restate > Overview > Greeter > Playground
export const { GET, POST } = serve();
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure Vercel project

With the GitHub repository set up, go over to [the Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/new) to create the project.

For Restate to push requests to the Vercel project, you need Vercel Generated URLs to be accessible.
You have two alternatives:

* Disable [Vercel Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication) for the project, making its URLs publicly accessible.
![Vercel Authentication](/img/services/deploy/vercel-disable-authentication.png)
* Enable [Protection Bypass for Automation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/protection-bypass-automation). This makes the URLs accessible only if the `x-vercel-protection-bypass` header is provided with the right value.

## Register the service to Restate

In order for Restate to push requests to your services, you need to [register the service to Restate](/services/versioning) using the CLI or UI.
Make sure to register the [Commit URL](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls#generated-from-git) so that Restate can address specific Vercel deployments:

```shell
npx @restatedev/restate deployments register \
  --use-http1.1 \
  https://<project-name>-<unique-hash>-<scope-slug>.vercel.app/restate
```

<Tip>
    `--use-http1.1` is required to interact with Next.js projects.
</Tip>

If you set up **Protection Bypass for Automation** as described above, pass the additional header as an argument:

```shell
npx @restatedev/restate deployments register \
    --use-http1.1 \
    --extra-header x-vercel-protection-bypass=<token> \
    https://<project-name>-<unique-hash>-<scope-slug>.vercel.app/restate
```

You're set up. Head over to the **Overview page > Greeter > Playground** and start sending requests to your service.

## Restate identity keys (for Restate Cloud)

In order to make sure only a specific Restate Cloud environment can push requests to your Vercel deployment,
head over to your Restate Cloud Dashboard to set up Restate identity keys.

    Set up Restate identity keys
</Card>

## CI/CD Automation

You can set up automation to automatically register new [Restate service versions](/services/versioning) every time a Vercel deployment gets promoted:

```yml
name: Register to Restate

# React to vercel.deployment.promoted event
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - 'vercel.deployment.promoted'
jobs:
  deploy-to-restate:
    if: github.event_name == 'repository_dispatch'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Register Restate deployment
        env:
          # In your Restate Cloud dashboard, go to Developers > API Keys > Create API Key, and make sure to select **Admin** for the role
          RESTATE_ADMIN_URL: ${{ secrets.RESTATE_ADMIN_URL }}
          # You can find this out in Developers > Admin URL.
          RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN }}

        # Run service registration
        run: |
          npx -y @restatedev/restate deployment register -y \
            --use-http1.1 \
            ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS_TOKEN && format('--extra-header x-vercel-protection-bypass={0}', secrets.VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS_TOKEN) }} \
            ${{ github.event.client_payload.url }}/restate
```

For this workflow to execute, you need to add the following [**GitHub Actions repository secrets**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets):
- `RESTATE_ADMIN_URL`: The Admin URL. You can find it in [Developers > Admin URL](https://cloud.restate.dev/to/developers/integration#admin)
- `RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Restate Cloud auth token. To get one, go to [Developers > API Keys > Create API Key](https://cloud.restate.dev/to/developers/integration?createApiKey=true&createApiKeyDescription=deployment-key&createApiKeyRole=rst:role::AdminAccess), and make sure to select **Admin** for the role

![Token setup](/img/services/deploy/deployment-token.png)

- If you set up the Protection Bypass for Automation as described above, add the secret `VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS_TOKEN` with the token value

<Accordion title={"Self-hosted Restate"}>
    You can use this workflow with Self-hosted Restate as well,
    just make sure to correctly set up `RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN` and `RESTATE_ADMIN_URL` to reach your Restate cluster.
