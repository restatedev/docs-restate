You can run your Restate services as serverless functions on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).


<Info>
    The easiest way to run Restate handlers on AWS Lambda is to use the [Restate CDK construct library](https://github.com/restatedev/cdk).
</Info>

To deploy a Restate service as a Lambda function, you can follow the [guidelines of AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-package.html)
for deploying plain TypeScript NodeJS functions. Restate does not add any complexity to this.

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Create a Lambda endpoint"}>
        Follow [the serving docs](/develop/ts/serving#creating-a-lambda-handler) to create a Lambda endpoint in your Restate service.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Build the zip file"}>
        Build a zip file containing the application code and dependencies and upload this to AWS Lambda.

        If you are using the Restate node template, then you can create a zip file with:

        ```shell
        npm run bundle
        ```

        AWS Lambda assumes that the handler can be found under `index.handler` in the uploaded code.
        By default, this is also the case for the Lambda functions developed with the Restate SDK.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Register the Lambda handler"}>
        [Register](/services/versioning#registering-deployments) the Lambda function ARN with Restate.
        Make sure you first publish a new version of the Lambda function before registering it with Restate.

        ```shell
        restate deployments register arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name:version
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
