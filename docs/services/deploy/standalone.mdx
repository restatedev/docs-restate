You can deploy your Restate service on any standalone machine.

## Docker

You can run your Restate service in a Docker container.

Most of the Restate service templates come with a `Dockerfile` that you can use to build a Docker image for your service.

## Running services behind a load balancer
If you want to spread load across multiple machines, it is best to put your services behind a load balancer (L4/L7).

If you want to run your service behind a load balancer, please make sure that you configure the load balancer to allow HTTP2 traffic.
