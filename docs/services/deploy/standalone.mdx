You can deploy your Restate service on any standalone machine. Restate services run as a separate process started either via the appropriate runtime (e.g. Node.js) or a standalone compiled binary (e.g. Rust) that accepts HTTP connections on a configured port, conventionally 9080.

## Docker

You can run your Restate service in a Docker container.

Most of the Restate service templates come with a `Dockerfile` that you can use to build a Docker image for your service.

## Running services behind a load balancer
To spread load across multiple instances of services and higher availability, we recommend using a load balancer. The Restate server does not currently support multiple endpoints for a single deployment.

When running an L7 load balancer such AWS Application Load Balancer, be sure to configure it to support HTTP/2 as this enables Restate to use the more efficient bi-directional service invocation protocol.
