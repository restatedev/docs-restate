You can run your Restate services as serverless functions on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

Get started using the [Workers+Restate template](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/typescript/templates/cloudflare-worker):
```shell CLI
restate example typescript-cloudflare-worker-hello-world &&
cd typescript-cloudflare-worker-hello-world
```

You can also add Restate into the standard `wrangler init` template, as long
as you have the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag set in `wrangler.toml`.

The SDK should be imported with the `fetch` component:
```shell
@restatedev/restate-sdk/fetch
```
and you would expose your endpoint to the Worker runtime with:
```ts
export default endpoint().bind(...).handler()
```

You can deploy with `wrangler deploy`, and register your deployed service:
```shell
restate deployments register https://my-service.my-domain.workers.dev
```

## Local development

A Workers dev server can be started on port 9080 using
```shell
wrangler dev --port 9080
```

`wrangler dev` only serves over HTTP1.1, so you'll need to register a local service with:
```shell
restate deployments register --use-http1.1 http://localhost:9080
```
