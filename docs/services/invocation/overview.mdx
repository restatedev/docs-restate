An invocation is a request to execute a handler. Each invocation has its own unique ID and lifecycle.

## Invocation ID

_Invocations_ have a unique **Invocation ID** starting with `inv_`. You can find this ID in every place where an invocation is mentioned:

- The invocations page of the [Restate UI](/installation#restate-ui)
- Logs and traces (`restate.invocation.id`), both in Restate and SDKs
- In CLI commands such as `restate invocation ls`
