The Python SDK has a testing harness to test your Restate handlers.

This uses [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to run a Restate Server in a Docker container and provides a client to let you test your Restate handlers.

## Setup
Install the package:
```bash
pip install restate_sdk[harness]
```

## Testing handlers

If you have a service as follows:
```python {"CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/testing.py#service"} 
import restate

greeter = restate.Service("greeter")


@greeter.handler()
async def greet(ctx: restate.Context, name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name}!"


app = restate.app(services=[greeter])
```

Then you can test it via:
```python {"CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/testing.py#testing"} 
import restate

with restate.test_harness(app) as harness:
    restate_client = harness.ingress_client()
    print(restate_client.post("/greeter/greet", json="Alice").json())
```
