## Durable sleep
To pause a handler for a set duration:

```go {"CODE_LOAD::go/develop/durabletimers.go#here"} 
if err := restate.Sleep(ctx, 10*time.Second); err != nil {
  return "", err
}
```

There is no hard limit on how long you can sleep. You can sleep for months or even years, but keep in mind:
- If you sleep in an [exclusive handler](/basics/functions#handler-behavior) in a Virtual Object, all other calls to this object will be queued.
- You need to keep the deployment version until the invocation completes (see [versioning](/operate/registration)).
So for long sleeps, we recommend breaking this up into multiple handlers that call each other with [delayed messages](/develop/go/service-communication#delayed-messages).

<Accordion title="Clock synchronization Restate Server vs. SDK">
    The Restate SDK calculates the wake-up time based on the delay you specify.
    The Restate Server then uses this calculated time to wake up the handler.
    If the Restate Server and the SDK have different system clocks, the sleep duration might not be accurate.
    So make sure that the system clock of the Restate Server and the SDK have the same timezone and are synchronized.
    A mismatch can cause timers to fire earlier or later than expected.
</Accordion>

## Scheduling async tasks

To invoke a handler at a later time, use [delayed messages](/develop/go/service-communication#delayed-messages).

<Accordion title={"Delayed messages vs. sleep and send"}>

In theory, you can schedule future work in Restate in two ways:
1. **Delayed messages** (recommended)
2. **Sleep + send** - sleeping in the current handler, then sending a message

At first sight, both approaches might seem to achieve similar results.
However, we recommend to use delayed messages for the following reasons:

- **Handler completes immediately**: The calling handler can finish execution and complete the invocation without waiting for the delay to finish
- **No Virtual Object blocking**: Other requests to the same Virtual Object can be processed during the delay period
- **Better for service versioning**: No long-running invocations that require keeping old service deployments around for a long time (see [service versioning](/operate/registration))
</Accordion>

## Timers and timeouts

Most context actions are async actions that return a future.

You can use [Restate's combinators](/develop/go/concurrent-tasks) to race an async operation against a timeout:

```go {"CODE_LOAD::go/develop/durabletimers.go#timer"} 
sleepFuture := restate.After(ctx, 30*time.Second)
callFuture := restate.Service[string](ctx, "MyService", "MyHandler").RequestFuture("hi")

selector := restate.Select(ctx, sleepFuture, callFuture)
switch selector.Select() {
case sleepFuture:
  if err := sleepFuture.Done(); err != nil {
    return "", err
  }
  return "sleep won", nil
case callFuture:
  result, err := callFuture.Response()
  if err != nil {
    return "", err
  }
  return fmt.Sprintf("call won with result: %s", result), nil
}
```

## Cron jobs

Restate does not yet include native cron support, but you can implement your own cron scheduler using:
- Durable timers
- Virtual Objects
- A repeat loop or sleep-schedule pattern

Check out the guide on [implementing cron jobs](/guides/cron-jobs).
