The Java SDK comes with the module `sdk-testing` that integrates with JUnit 5 and [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to start up a Restate container together with your services code and automatically register them.

```kotlin
implementation("dev.restate:sdk-testing:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
```

## Using the JUnit 5 Extension

Given the service to test `MyService`, annotate the test class with `@RestateTest` and annotate the services to bind with `@BindService`:

<CodeGroup>
```java Java {"CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/MyServiceTest.java#extension"} 
@RestateTest
class MyServiceTest {

  @BindService MyService service = new MyService();

  // Your tests

}
```
```kotlin Kotlin {"CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/MyServiceTest.kt#extension"} 
@RestateTest
class MyServiceTest {

  @BindService val service = MyService()

  // Your tests

}
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that the extension will start one Restate server for the whole test class. For more details, checkout [`RestateTest` Javadocs](https://docs.restate.dev/javadocs/dev/restate/sdk/testing/RestateTest.html).

Once the extension is set, you can implement your test methods as usual, and inject a [`Client`](https://docs.restate.dev/javadocs/dev/restate/client/Client.html) using [`@RestateClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/javadocs/dev/restate/sdk/testing/RestateClient.html) to interact with Restate and the registered services:

<CodeGroup>
```java Java {"CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/MyServiceTestMethod.java#test"} 
@Test
void testMyHandler(@RestateClient Client ingressClient) {
  // Create the service client from the injected ingress client
  var client = MyServiceClient.fromClient(ingressClient);

  // Send request to service and assert the response
  var response = client.myHandler("Hi");
  assertEquals(response, "Hi!");
}
```
```kotlin Kotlin {"CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/MyServiceTestMethod.kt#test"} 
@Test
fun testMyHandler(@RestateClient ingressClient: Client) = runTest {
  // Create the service client from the injected ingress client
  val client = MyServiceClient.fromClient(ingressClient)

  // Send request to service and assert the response
  val response = client.myHandler("Hi")
  assertEquals(response, "Hi!")
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage without JUnit 5

You can use the testing tools without JUnit 5 by using [`RestateRunner`](https://docs.restate.dev/javadocs/dev/restate/sdk/testing/RestateRunner.html) directly.
For more details, refer to the Javadocs.
