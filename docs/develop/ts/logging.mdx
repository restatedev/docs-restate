The Typescript SDK contains an internal logger.

## Log levels
The SDK logging filters based on the level.

The level is set by the `RESTATE_LOGGING` environment variable and the level values can be `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` or `ERROR`.

The default log level is `INFO` if `NODE_ENV=production` is set, otherwise is `DEBUG`.

If you set the level to `TRACE`, you can also get more verbose logging of the journal by setting the environment variable `RESTATE_JOURNAL_LOGGING=TRACE`.

## Console logging

If you use the default Node console logger, log statements will be printed over and over again during replays.
To avoid this, you can use the Restate context logger, which is a wrapper around the console logger that suppresses duplicate log statements during replays:

```typescript {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/logging.ts} 
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const service = restate.object({
  name: "Greeter",
  handlers: {
    greet: async (ctx: restate.ObjectContext, name: string) => {
      ctx.console.info("This will not be printed again during replays");
      ctx.console.debug("This will not be printed again during replays");
      // Any other console logging method can be used
    },
  },
});
```

This logger uses the same level filtering as described above.
