Restate services can run in a few ways: as a Node.js HTTP handler, as an AWS
Lambda handler, or on other Javascript runtimes like Bun, Deno and Cloudflare
Workers.

## Creating a Node.js HTTP handler

Use `restate.serve` to serve the provided services, starting an HTTP/2 server on port `9080`.

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#endpoint"} 
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";
restate.serve({
  services: [myService, myVirtualObject, myWorkflow],
});
```

<Accordion title="Customizing the HTTP2 server">

If you need to manually control or customize the HTTP2 server, use `restate.createEndpointHandler` to create a Node HTTP/2 handler, and then use it to manually instantiate the HTTP server:

```ts {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#custom_endpoint"} 
const http2Handler = restate.createEndpointHandler({
  services: [myService, myVirtualObject, myWorkflow],
});
const httpServer = http2.createServer(http2Handler);
httpServer.listen();
```

</Accordion>

## Creating a Lambda handler

To register your service as a Lambda function, use the `/lambda` import
component and use `restate.createEndpointHandler`:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving_lambda.ts#lambda"} 
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk/lambda";
export const handler = restate.createEndpointHandler({
  services: [myService, myVirtualObject, myWorkflow],
});
```

The implementation of your services and handlers remains the same for both deployment options.

Have a look at the [deployment section](/services/deploy/lambda)
for guidance on how to deploy your services on AWS Lambda.

## Creating a Deno/Cloudflare Workers handler

Other Javascript runtimes like Deno and Cloudflare Workers have
built on top of the [Fetch Standard](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch) for
defining HTTP server handlers. To register your service as a fetch handler, use
the `/fetch` import component.

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving_fetch.ts#fetch"} 
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk/fetch";
const handler = restate.createEndpointHandler({
  services: [myService, myVirtualObject, myWorkflow],
});
// Cloudflare expects the handler as a default export
export default handler;
// Deno expects to be passed the fetch function
Deno.serve({ port: 9080 }, handler);
```
By default, a fetch handler will not advertise itself as working
bidirectionally; the SDK will end the HTTP request at each suspension point,
and the Restate runtime will re-invoke the service when there is more work to
do.

However, you can use the option `bidirectional: true` to change this on supported platforms,
which will improve latencies once the service is re-registered with the runtime.
- Deno (including Deno Deploy) supports HTTP2 and therefore bidirectional mode can be enabled.
- Cloudflare Workers do not support end-to-end HTTP2 or bidirectional HTTP1.1,
and enabling bidirectional mode will cause invocations to stall and time out.
Services running on Workers must be discovered with the `--use-http1.1`
CLI flag.

<Accordion title="Cloudflare Workers and minification">

    Cloudflare Workers minification is not working correctly with the Restate SDK. If you see an issue similar to:

    ```
    ✘ [ERROR] restate-cloudflare-worker: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__wbindgen_malloc')
    ```

    Then most likely you have enabled minification when deploying. Disable it with `minify = false` in your `workers.toml` file.
</Accordion>

## Validating request identity

SDKs can validate that incoming requests come from a particular Restate
instance. You can find out more about request identity in the [Security docs](/services/security#locking-down-service-access)

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#identity"} 
restate.serve({
  services: [myService],
  identityKeys: ["publickeyv1_w7YHemBctH5Ck2nQRQ47iBBqhNHy4FV7t2Usbye2A6f"],
});
```
