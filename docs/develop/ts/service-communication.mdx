title: "Service Communication"
description: "Call other services from your handler."
---

A handler can interact with other handlers in three ways:
- [Request-response calls](/ts/service-communication#request-response-calls): Waits for a reply.
- [One-way messages](/ts/service-communication#sending-messages): Sends a message without waiting for a response (a.k.a. fire-and-forget).
- [Delayed messages](/ts/service-communication#delayed-messages): Sends a message after a delay without waiting for a response. 

<Note>
**Export service definition**: To call a service, ensure its definition is exported ([see Service Overview](/develop/ts/overview#services)):
 ```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_service.ts#api_export}
export const MyService: typeof myService = { name: "MyService" };
```
Then, import this definition into the handler that will make the call.
</Note> 

## Request-response calls

In request-response communication, the caller waits for a reply from the callee.

To do the call, use the [`serviceClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#serviceclient), [`objectClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#objectclient), or [`workflowClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#workflowclient). For calling Virtual Objects and Workflows, you need to supply the ID you want to call.

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#request_response}
// To call a Service:
const svcResponse = await ctx.serviceClient(MyService).myHandler("Hi");

// To call a Virtual Object:
const objResponse = await ctx
  .objectClient(MyObject, "Mary")
  .myHandler("Hi");
  
// To call a Workflow:
// `run` handler — can only be called once per workflow ID
const wfResponse = await ctx
  .workflowClient(MyWorkflow, "wf-id")
  .run("Hi");
// Other handlers can be called anytime within workflow retention
const result = await ctx
  .workflowClient(MyWorkflow, "wf-id")
  .interactWithWorkflow();
```

Use [`ctx.genericCall`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#genericcall) if you don’t have a typed service definition or need to use dynamic strings (e.g. for [workflow interpreters](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/typescript/end-to-end-applications/ai-image-workflows)):

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#generic_call}
const response = await ctx.genericCall({
  service: "MyObject",
  method: "myHandler",
  parameter: "Hi",
  key: "Mary", // drop this for Service calls
  inputSerde: restate.serde.json,
  outputSerde: restate.serde.json,
});
```

<Tip>
    All calls are proxied via Restate and get logged and retried. 
</Tip>

<Note>
**Workflow retention**: After the run handler completes, other handlers can still be called for up to 24 hours (default).
You can configure this via the UI or [Admin API](/adminapi/modify-service) with `workflow_completion_retention`.
</Note>

<Note>
Request-response calls between Virtual Objects may lead to deadlocks:
- Cross deadlock: A → B and B → A (same keys).
- Cycle deadlock: A → B → C → A.

Use the UI or CLI to [cancel](/operate/invocation#cancelling-invocations) and unblock deadlocked invocations.
</Note>

## Sending messages

Send a message without awaiting a response.

To do send the message, use the [`serviceSendClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#servicesendclient), [`objectSendClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#objectsendclient), or [`workflowSendClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#workflowsendclient). For calling Virtual Objects and Workflows, you need to supply the ID you want to call.

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#one_way}
// To message a Service:
ctx.serviceSendClient(MyService).myHandler("Hi");

// To message a Virtual Object:
ctx.objectSendClient(MyObject, "Mary").myHandler("Hi");

// To message a Workflow:
// `run` handler — can only be called once per workflow ID
ctx.workflowSendClient(MyWorkflow, "wf-id").run("Hi");
// Other handlers can be called anytime within workflow retention
ctx.workflowSendClient(MyWorkflow, "wf-id").interactWithWorkflow();
```


Use [`ctx.genericSend`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#genericsend) if you don’t have a typed service definition or need to use dynamic strings:

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#generic_send}
ctx.genericSend({
  service: "MyService",
  method: "myHandler",
  parameter: "Hi",
  inputSerde: restate.serde.json,
});
```

<Tip>   
    Typically, you'd need a message queue for reliable delivery. Restate handles this internally by logging and retrying messages automatically.
</Tip>

<Note>
    Calls to a Virtual Object execute in order of arrival, serially.
    Example:

    ```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#ordering}
ctx.objectSendClient(MyObject, "Mary").myHandler("I'm call A");
ctx.objectSendClient(MyObject, "Mary").myHandler("I'm call B");
```

    Call A is guaranteed to execute before B. However, other invocations may interleave between A and B.
</Note>

## Delayed messages

Schedule a one-way message to execute after a delay.

To do send the delayed message, use the [`serviceSendClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#servicesendclient), [`objectSendClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#objectsendclient), or [`workflowSendClient`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#workflowsendclient) and specify a delay in the [`sendOpts`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/types/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ClientSendOptions). For calling Virtual Objects and Workflows, you need to supply the ID you want to call.


```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#delayed}
// To message a Service with a delay:
ctx
  .serviceSendClient(MyService)
  .myHandler("Hi", restate.rpc.sendOpts({ delay: { seconds: 5 } }));

// To message a Virtual Object with a delay:
ctx
  .objectSendClient(MyObject, "Mary")
  .myHandler("Hi", restate.rpc.sendOpts({ delay: { seconds: 5 } }));

// To message a Workflow with a delay:
ctx
  .workflowSendClient(MyWorkflow, "Mary")
  .run("Hi", restate.rpc.sendOpts({ delay: { seconds: 5 } }));
```

Use [`ctx.genericSend`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#genericsend) with a delay if you don’t have a typed service definition or need to use dynamic strings:

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#generic_delayed}
ctx.genericSend({
  service: "MyService",
  method: "myHandler",
  parameter: "Hi",
  inputSerde: restate.serde.json,
  delay: { seconds: 5 },
});
```

<Tip>
    Use this functionality to schedule async tasks.
    Restate will make sure the task gets executed at the desired time.
</Tip>


## Using an idempotency key

Restate provides exactly-once semantics, but duplicate requests may still come from external clients or different services.

To avoid duplicate requests, use an idempotency key via [`restate.rpc.opts`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/functions/_restatedev_restate-sdk.rpc.opts) or [`restate.rpc.sendOpts`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/functions/_restatedev_restate-sdk.rpc.sendOpts).

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#idempotency_key}
// For request-response
const response = await ctx.serviceClient(MyService).myHandler(
  "Hi",
  restate.rpc.opts({
    idempotencyKey: "my-idempotency-key",
  })
);
// For sending a message
ctx.serviceSendClient(MyService).myHandler(
  "Hi",
  restate.rpc.sendOpts({
    idempotencyKey: "my-idempotency-key",
  })
);
```

## Attach to an invocation

Use [`ctx.attach`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#attach), to attach to an already-sent invocation to wait for it or retrieve its result.

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#attach}
const handle = ctx.serviceSendClient(MyService).myHandler(
  "Hi",
  restate.rpc.sendOpts({
    idempotencyKey: "my-idempotency-key",
  })
);
const invocationId = await handle.invocationId;

// Later...
const response = ctx.attach(invocationId);
```

If an idempotency key was used, you can both wait for completion and retrieve the result.
Restate persists the responses of these requests for the configured retention time.

Without an idempotency key, you can only wait, not retrieve the result.


## Cancel an invocation

Use [`ctx.cancel`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#cancel) to [cancel an invocation](/operate/invocation/#cancelling-invocations):

```ts  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#cancel}
const handle = ctx.serviceSendClient(MyService).myHandler("Hi");
const invocationId = await handle.invocationId;

// Cancel the invocation
ctx.cancel(invocationId);
```
