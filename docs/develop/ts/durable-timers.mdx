Restate provides durable, fault-tolerant timers that allow you to:
- [Sleep](/ts/durable-timers#durable-sleep): Pause a handler for a given duration 
- [Send delayed messages](/ts/service-communication#delayed-messages): Schedule handler invocations in the future
- [Set timeouts](/ts/durable-timers#timers-and-timeouts) for async operations
- Implement patterns like [cron jobs](/ts/durable-timers#cron-jobs)

## Why use Restate for timers?

Restate tracks and manages timers, ensuring they survive failures and restarts.
For example, if a service is sleeping for 12 hours and fails after 8 hours, then Restate will make sure it only sleeps 4 hours more.  

If your handler runs on function-as-a-service platforms like AWS Lambda, Restate suspends the handler while it is sleeping, to free up resources.
Since these platforms charge on execution time, this saves costs.

## Durable sleep
To pause a handler for a set duration:

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/durable_timers.ts#sleep}
await ctx.sleep({ seconds: 10 });
```

Note that if you sleep in an exclusive handler in a Virtual Object, all other calls to this object will be queued.  

<Accordion title="Clock synchronization Restate Server vs. SDK">
    The Restate SDK calculates the wake-up time based on the delay you specify.
    The Restate Server then uses this calculated time to wake up the handler.
    If the Restate Server and the SDK have different system clocks, the sleep duration might not be accurate.
    So make sure that the system clock of the Restate Server and the SDK have the same timezone and are synchronized.
    A mismatch can cause timers to fire earlier or later than expected.
</Accordion>

## Scheduling async tasks

To invoke a handler at a later time, use delayed messages.

See the documentation on [delayed messages](/ts/service-communication#delayed-messages) for more details.

## Timers and timeouts

Most context actions are async actions that return a [`RestatePromise`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/types/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RestatePromise).

`RestatePromise` supports setting timeouts, allowing you to bound how long your code waits for an operation.

When an operation times out, it throws a [`TimeoutError`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/classes/_restatedev_restate-sdk.TimeoutError).

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/durable_timers.ts#timer}
try {
  await ctx.serviceClient(MyService).myHandler("Hi")
      .orTimeout({ seconds: 5 });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof restate.TimeoutError) {
    console.error("Operation timed out:", error);
  } else {
    throw error; // Re-throw other errors
  }
}
```

## Cron jobs

Restate does not yet include native cron support, but you can implement your own cron scheduler using:
- Durable timers
- Virtual Objects
- A repeat loop or sleep-schedule pattern

Check out the guide on [implementing cron jobs](/guides/cron-jobs).
