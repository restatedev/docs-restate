title: "Journaling Results"
description: "Persist results of operations."
---

Restate uses an execution log to replay operations after failures and suspensions. This means that non-deterministic results (such as database responses or UUID generation) need to have their results journaled (persisted) for deterministic replay.

The SDK helps with this via:

1. **[Journaled actions](/develop/ts/journaling-results#journaled-actions)**: Wrap any code block in `ctx.run(...)` to persist its result.
2. **[Deterministic randoms](/develop/ts/journaling-results#generating-randoms)**: Generate UUIDs and random numbers that are deterministic on retries.
3. **[`RestatePromise` combinators](/develop/ts/journaling-results#combineable-promise-combinators)**: Run multiple async operations in parallel while preserving the exact order of resolution.

## Journaled actions
Use [`ctx.run`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/interfaces/_restatedev_restate-sdk.Context#run) to safely wrap any non-deterministic operation, like HTTP calls or database responses, and have Restate store its result in the execution log.

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#side_effect}
const result = await ctx.run<string>(async () => doDbRequest());
```

<Note>
Inside `ctx.run`, you **cannot use** the Restate context (e.g., `ctx.get`, `ctx.call`, or nested `ctx.run`).
</Note>

<Note>
By default, results are serialized using [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON). See the [serialization docs](/develop/ts/serialization) to customize this.
</Note>

<Note>
Failures in `ctx.run` are treated the same as any other handler error. Restate will retry it unless configured otherwise or unless a [`TerminalError`](/develop/ts/error-handling) is thrown.
</Note>

<Accordion title="Long-running business logic: setting the abort and inacitivity timeout">
  If Restate doesn't receive new journal entries from a service for more than one minute (by default), it will automatically abort the invocation and retry it.

  However, some business logic can take longer to complete—for example, an LLM call that takes up to 3 minutes to respond.

  In such cases, you can adjust the service’s [abort timeout](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/types/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ServiceOptions#aborttimeout) and [inactivity timeout](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/types/_restatedev_restate-sdk.ServiceOptions#inactivitytimeout) settings to accommodate longer execution times.

  For more information, see the [error handling guide](/guides/error-handling).

### Run-block retry policies

You can customize how `ctx.run` retries via the [`RunOptions`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/types/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RunOptions):

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/retries.ts?1}
try {
  const myRunRetryPolicy = {
    initialRetryInterval: { milliseconds: 500 },
    retryIntervalFactor: 2,
    maxRetryInterval: { seconds: 1 },
    maxRetryAttempts: 5,
    maxRetryDuration: { seconds: 1 },
  };
  await ctx.run("write", () => writeToOtherSystem(), myRunRetryPolicy);
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof restate.TerminalError) {
    // Undo or compensate here (see Sagas guide)
  }
  throw e;
}
```

* You can limit retries by time or count
* When the policy is exhausted, a `TerminalError` is thrown
* See [Error Handling](/develop/ts/error-handling) and the [Sagas Guide](/guides/sagas) for patterns like compensation

## Deterministic randoms

The SDK provides deterministic helpers for random values — seeded by the invocation ID — so they return the **same result on retries**.

### UUIDs

Use `ctx.rand.uuidv4()` to generate stable UUIDs for things like idempotency keys:

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#uuid}
const uuid = ctx.rand.uuidv4();
```

### Random numbers

Use `ctx.rand.random()` to generate a deterministic float between `0` and `1`:


```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#random_nb}
const randomNumber = ctx.rand.random();
```

This behaves like `Math.random()` but is deterministically replayable.


## `RestatePromise` combinators

To run multiple operations concurrently and deterministically, use `RestatePromise` combinators.
Restate then logs the order in which they get resolved or rejected so they are deterministic on replay.

```typescript  {CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#all}
const sleepPromise = ctx.sleep({ milliseconds: 100 });
const callPromise = ctx.serviceClient(MyService).myHandler("Hi");
const externalCallPromise = ctx.run(() => httpCall());

const resultArray = await RestatePromise.all([
  sleepPromise,
  callPromise,
  externalCallPromise,
]);
```

Restate provides the following deterministic combinators:
- [`RestatePromise.all`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/variables/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RestatePromise#all): similar to [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)
- [`RestatePromise.any`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/variables/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RestatePromise#any): similar to [`Promise.any`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any)
- [`RestatePromise.race`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/variables/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RestatePromise#race): similar to [`Promise.race`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)
- [`RestatePromise.allSettled`](https://docs.restate.dev/tsdocs/variables/_restatedev_restate-sdk.RestatePromise#allsettled): similar to [`Promise.allSettled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)
