The Typescript SDK has a companion library which makes it easy to test against a Restate container:
[`@restatedev/restate-sdk-testcontainers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@restatedev/restate-sdk-testcontainers).

This uses [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to run a Restate Server in a Docker container and let you test your Restate handlers.

## Setup
`RestateTestEnvironment.start` creates a Restate container and executes a user-provided closure to register services.
An optional second argument allows you to specify a custom [Testcontainer](https://node.testcontainers.org/) for Restate.

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#setup"} 
describe("ExampleObject", () => {
  // import { RestateTestEnvironment } from "@restatedev/restate-sdk-testcontainers";
  let restateTestEnvironment: RestateTestEnvironment;
  // import * as clients from "@restatedev/restate-sdk-clients";
  let restateIngress: clients.Ingress;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    restateTestEnvironment = await RestateTestEnvironment.start({
      services: [router],
    });
    restateIngress = clients.connect({ url: restateTestEnvironment.baseUrl() });
  }, 20_000);

  afterAll(async () => {
    if (restateTestEnvironment !== undefined) {
      await restateTestEnvironment.stop();
    }
  });
```

## Calling services
The Restate ingress client can be used as usual (see the [clients documentation](/services/invocation/clients/typescript-sdk))

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#methods"} 
it("Can call methods", async () => {
  const client = restateIngress.objectClient(router, "myKey");

  await client.greet("Test!");
});
```

## Checking and mutating state
The `stateOf` method on the `RestateTestEnvironment` class can be used to obtain a handle on the Virtual Object / Workflow state
for a particular key.

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#state"} 
it("Can read state", async () => {
  const state = restateTestEnvironment.stateOf(router, "myKey");

  expect(await state.getAll()).toStrictEqual({});
  expect(await state.get("count")).toBeNull();
});

it("Can write state", async () => {
  const state = restateTestEnvironment.stateOf(router, "myKey");

  await state.setAll({
    count: 123,
  });
  await state.set("count", 321);
});
```

## Typed state
`stateOf` can be provided with a type for the services state, to allow for type-safe state operations.

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#typedstate"} 
type ServiceState = { count: number };

it("Can operate on typed state", async () => {
  const state = restateTestEnvironment.stateOf<ServiceState>(router, "myKey");

  await state.setAll({ count: 1 });
  await state.set("count", 2);
});
```
