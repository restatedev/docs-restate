Restate is a lightweight runtime to turn AI agents, workflows, and backend services into durable processes. Focus on your logic, not failure mechanics.
Write normal code and let Restate handles resilience and consistency automatically.

## Key capabilities

**Durable execution**: Code automatically stores completed steps and resumes from where it left off when recovering from failures.

**Built-in state**: Maintain state beyond workflow executions and share it between functions with strong consistency guarantees.

**Reliable communication**: Call services sync or async with guaranteed execution and exactly-once semantics.

**Time-based coordination**: Sleep, schedule, and wait for external events with durable timers.

**Workflows**: Coordinate long-running processes, human approvals, listen to webhooks and other signals.
