Restate provides durable building blocks that makes building resilient applications simple. Write normal code while Restate handles failures, coordination, and state consistency automatically.

## Why Restate?

Building reliable distributed systems is hard.
Systems can fail in so many ways: infrastructure failures, network partitions, timeouts, race conditions, corrupted state, etc. Traditional approaches require extensive error handling, state management, and retry logic scattered throughout your codebase.

Restate eliminates this complexity.

## What is Restate?

Restate is a system that makes your applications durable, reliable, and stateful. It turns regular functions into fault-tolerant building blocks that can survive failures, restarts, and infrastructure issues without losing progress or duplicating work.

Instead of building complex retry logic, state management, and coordination mechanisms, you write straightforward business logic. Restate handles all the reliability concerns behind the scenes.

## Key capabilities

**Durable execution**: Functions automatically retry and resume from exactly where they left off after failures, without re-executing completed work.

**Built-in K/V state**: Store and retrieve data directly in your functions without external databases, with strong consistency guarantees.

**Reliable communication**: Call functions across services with automatic retries, exactly-once delivery, and durable execution.

**Time-based coordination**: Sleep, schedule, and wait for external events with durable timers that survive restarts.

**Workflows**: Coordinate long-running processes, human approvals, and external system integrations with ease.
