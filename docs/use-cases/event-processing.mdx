## Why Restate for Event Processing?

Kafka event processing requires managing Kafka consumers, handling retries, maintaining state stores, and coordinating complex workflows. Restate eliminates this complexity by providing **lightweight, transactional event processing** with zero consumer management and built-in state.

## Transactional Event Processing

Build event handlers with complex workflows, loops, timers, and transactional guarantees:

```typescript
const userFeed = restate.object({
  name: "userFeed",
  handlers: {
    processPost: async (ctx: restate.ObjectContext, post: SocialMediaPost) => {
      const userId = ctx.key;

      const postId = await ctx.run(() => createPost(userId, post));

      // Wait for processing to complete with durable timers
      while ((await ctx.run(() => getPostStatus(postId))) === PENDING) {
        await ctx.sleep({ seconds: 5 });
      }

      await ctx.run(() => updateUserFeed(userId, postId));
    },
  },
});
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Push-based delivery**: Events delivered directly to handlers with zero consumer management
- **Automatic retries**: Failed handlers are retried with exponential backoff until they succeed
- **Durable execution**: Handlers survive failures and resume exactly where they left off
- **Parallel processing**: Events for different keys process concurrently

## Stateful Event Handlers

Maintain persistent state across events without external stores:

```typescript
const packageTracker = restate.object({
  name: "package-tracker",
  handlers: {
    registerPackage: async (ctx: ObjectContext, packageInfo: PackageInfo) => {
      ctx.set("package-info", packageInfo);
    },

    updateLocation: async (
      ctx: ObjectContext,
      locationUpdate: LocationUpdate
    ) => {
      const packageInfo = await ctx.get<PackageInfo>("package-info");
      if (!packageInfo) {
        throw new TerminalError(`Package not found`);
      }

      (packageInfo.locations ??= []).push(locationUpdate);
      ctx.set("package-info", packageInfo);
    },

    getPackageInfo: shared((ctx: ObjectSharedContext) =>
      ctx.get<PackageInfo>("package-info")
    ),
  },
});
```

## Comparison with Other Solutions

| Feature | Restate | Traditional Kafka Processing | Stream Processing Frameworks |
|---------|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Event Delivery** | Push-based to durable handlers | Polling-based consumer groups | Built-in sources and sinks |
| **Consumer Management** | Zero configuration | Manual offset and consumer group management | Zero configuration |
| **Failure Recovery** | Fine-grained progress persistence with durable side effects | Coarse-grained offset commits with potential reprocessing | Coarse-grained checkpointing with potential duplicate side effects |
| **State Management** | Built-in durable state | External state store required | Built-in state store |
| **Queuing Semantics** | Queue-per-key with ordering guarantees | Queue-per-partition with ordering guarantees | Queue-per-partition (inherited from Kafka) |
| **Complex Workflows** | Unlimited control flow: loops, timers, conditions | Long-running logic blocks consumer loop; requires external services | DAG-based processing with limited control flow |
| **Best For** | Event-driven state machines, transactional processing, complex workflows | Simple ETL and message processing | High-throughput analytics, aggregations, joins |
