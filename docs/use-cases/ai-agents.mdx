## Why Restate for AI Agents?
AI agents make multiple LLM calls and tool executions that can fail due to rate limits, network issues, or service outages.
Restate solves these challenges by making agents **resilient to failures**, **stateful across conversations**, and **observable** without managing complex retry logic or external state stores.

### Resilient Agent Execution

Restate uses Durable Execution to make your agents withstand failures without losing progress.
The Restate SDK records the steps the agent executes in a log and replays them if the process crashes or is restarted.

**Automatic Recovery Features:**
- **LLM call persistence**: Every model response is saved and replayed during recovery
- **Tool execution durability**: Steps within tool executions are retried until they succeed
- **State consistency**: Agent state remains consistent across failures and restarts

### Simple Integration with AI SDKs

Combine the Restate SDK with popular AI frameworks like Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI Agent SDK and turn brittle agents in to fault-tolerant workflows:
```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use-cases/agents/weather-agent.ts#here"} 
const model = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  middleware: durableCalls(restateContext, { maxRetryAttempts: 3 }),
});

const {text} = await generateText({
  model,
  system: "You are an employee onboarding agent.",
  prompt: `Onboard employee ${name} in team ${team}, as ${job}`,
  tools: {
    getOnboardingPlan: tool({
      description: "Get onboarding plan for team and job",
      inputSchema: OnboardingInfo,
      execute: async ({ name, team, job }) =>
          restateContext.run("get plan", () => getOnboardingPlan(name, team, job)),
    }),
    createEmail,
    reserveLaptop,
    orderKeyCard,
    orderPersonalizedHoodie
  },
  stopWhen: [stepCountIs(10)],
  providerOptions: { openai: { parallelToolCalls: false } },
});
```

- **Vercel AI SDK**: Use Restate's `durableCalls` middleware to persist LLM responses automatically
- **Tool execution**: Make tool execution steps resilient Restate Context actions
- **Flexibility**: Works with your existing deployment - Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, or any serverless platform
- **Integration**: From simple agents to complex multi-agent orchestration systems

### Built-in Observability

Track every step of your agent's execution with detailed traces and state inspection:

</Frame>

- **Complete execution timeline**: See every LLM call, tool execution, and state change
- **Debug failed agents**: Inspect exactly where and why agents failed
- **OpenTelemetry integration**: Export traces to Langfuse, DataDog, or custom systems

## Key AI Agent Patterns

### Stateful Conversational Agents

Maintain conversation history and context across multiple interactions using Virtual Objects:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use-cases/agents/chat.ts#here"} 
const chat = restate.object({
  name: "Chat",
  handlers: {
    message: async (ctx: restate.ObjectContext, message: string) => {
      const messages = await ctx.get<Message[]>("messages") ?? [];
      messages.push({ role: "user", content: message });

      const result = await runAgent(ctx, messages);

      ctx.set("messages", [...messages, ...result.response.messages]);
      return result.text;
    },
  },
});
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

Implement resilient approval workflows and human oversight without complex infrastructure:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use-cases/agents/agent-actions.ts#approval"} 
const approval = ctx.awakeable<boolean>();
await ctx.run("request-approval", () =>
  sendApprovalRequest(approval.id, request)
);
const approved = await approval.promise;
```

- **Durable waiting**: Waiting continues across crashes and restarts
- **Timeout handling**: Set crash-proof timeouts with automatic escalation paths
- **Cost efficiency**: No compute costs while waiting on serverless platforms

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Coordinate specialized agents for complex tasks with reliable communication:

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use-cases/agents/agent-actions.ts#multi"} 
const [eligibility, fraud, cost] = await RestatePromise.all([
  ctx.serviceClient(eligibilityAgent).analyze(claim),
  ctx.serviceClient(fraudAgent).analyze(claim),
  ctx.serviceClient(costAgent).analyze(claim),
]);

const decision = await generateText({
  model,
  prompt: `Make decision based on: ${eligibility}, ${fraud}, ${cost}`,
});
```

Restate acts as durable queue and RPC layer between agents running in separate processes.

## When to Choose Restate

**âœ… Choose Restate when you need:**
- **Durable Execution**: Crash-safe LLM/tool calls and deterministic retries. Agents resume at the last successful step.
- **Journal Observability**: Auto-captured journal of every step, retry, and message for easy debugging and auditing.
- **Human-in-the-loop & long waits**: Suspend while waiting for user approval or slow jobs; pay for compute, not wall-clock time.
- **Stateful sessions / memory**: Virtual Objects keep multi-turn conversations and other state isolated and consistent.
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Reliable RPC, queuing, and scheduling between agents running in separate processes.
