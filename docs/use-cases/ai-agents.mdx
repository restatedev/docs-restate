## Why Restate for AI Agents?

AI agent implementations struggle with reliability and state management. When agents make multiple LLM calls, tool executions, or API requests, any failure can lose context and progress. Restate solves these challenges by providing **durable execution**, **automatic recovery**, and **built-in observability** for AI agents.

### Resilient Agent Execution

AI agents are inherently fragile - they make expensive LLM calls, interact with rate-limited APIs, and perform complex multi-step workflows. Restate's durable execution ensures your agents recover automatically from any failure without losing progress.

**Automatic Recovery Features:**
- **LLM call persistence**: Every model response is saved and replayed during recovery
- **Tool execution durability**: External API calls are retried until they succeed
- **State consistency**: Agent state remains consistent across failures

### Simple Integration with AI SDKs

Restate works seamlessly with popular AI frameworks like Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI Agent SDK. No need to rewrite your existing agent logic:
```typescript
const weatherAgent = restate.service({
  name: "WeatherAgent",
  handlers: {
    run: async (ctx: restate.Context, prompt: string) => {
      const model = wrapLanguageModel({
        model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
        middleware: durableCalls(ctx, { maxRetryAttempts: 3 }),
      });

      const result = await generateText({
        model,
        tools: {
          getWeather: tool({
            description: "Get weather for a city",
            parameters: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
            execute: async ({ city }) =>
              ctx.run("fetch-weather", () => fetchWeather(city)),
          }),
        },
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
      });

      return result.text;
    },
  },
});
```

- **Vercel AI SDK**: Use Restate's `durableCalls` middleware to persist LLM responses
- **Tool execution**: Make tool execution steps resilient with Restate Context actions
- **Flexiblity**: From simple agents to low-level multi-agent systems

### Built-in Observability

Track every step of your agent's execution with detailed traces and state inspection:

- **Complete execution timeline**: See every LLM call, tool execution, and state change
- **Debug failed agents**: Inspect exactly where and why agents failed
- **OpenTelemetry integration**: Export traces to Langfuse, DataDog, or custom systems

## Key AI Agent Patterns

### Stateful Conversational Agents

Maintain conversation history and context across multiple interactions using Virtual Objects:

```typescript
const chatSession = restate.object({
  name: "ChatSession",
  handlers: {
    message: async (ctx: ObjectContext, message: string) => {
      const messages = (await ctx.get("history")) ?? [];
      messages.push({ role: "user", content: message });

      const response = await generateText({
        model: wrapLanguageModel({
          model: openai("gpt-4o"),
          middleware: durableCalls(ctx),
        }),
        messages,
      });

      ctx.set("history", [...messages, ...response.messages]);
      return response.text;
    },
  },
});
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

Implement resilient approval workflows and human oversight without complex infrastructure:

```typescript
const approval = await ctx.awakeable<boolean>();
await ctx.run("request-approval", () => 
  sendApprovalRequest(approval.id, decision)
);
const decision = await approval.promise;
```

- **Durable waiting**: Waiting continues across crashes and restarts
- **Timeout handling**: Set crash-proof timeouts with automatic escalation paths
- **Cost efficiency**: No compute costs while waiting on serverless platforms

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Coordinate specialized agents for complex tasks with reliable communication:

```typescript
const [eligibility, fraud, cost] = await Promise.all([
  ctx.serviceClient(eligibilityAgent).analyze(claim),
  ctx.serviceClient(fraudAgent).analyze(claim),
  ctx.serviceClient(costAgent).analyze(claim),
]);

const decision = await generateText({
  model,
  prompt: `Make decision based on: ${eligibility}, ${fraud}, ${cost}`,
});
```

### Long-Running Background Agents

Build agents that run continuously in the background, monitoring events and taking actions over extended periods:

```typescript
const mediaMonitorAgent = restate.service({
  name: "MediaMonitor",
  handlers: {
    monitor: async (ctx: restate.Context, config: { 
      keywords: string[], 
      intervalHours: number 
    }) => {
      const model = wrapLanguageModel({
        model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
        middleware: durableCalls(ctx),
      });

      // Fetch recent mentions across platforms
      const mentions = await ctx.run("fetch-mentions", () =>
        fetchSocialMentions(config.keywords)
      );

      if (mentions.length > 0) {
        // Analyze sentiment and key themes
        const analysis = await generateText({
          model,
          prompt: `Analyze these social media mentions: ${JSON.stringify(mentions)}. 
                   Summarize sentiment, key themes, and any urgent issues.`,
        });

        // Store analysis and alert if needed
        await ctx.run("process-analysis", () => 
          processMediaAnalysis(analysis.text, mentions)
        );
      }

      // Schedule next monitoring cycle
      await ctx.serviceClient(mediaMonitorAgent)
        .monitor(config, { delay: config.intervalHours * 60 * 60 * 1000 });
    },
  },
});
```

- **Self-scheduling**: Agents schedule their own next execution cycle
- **Persistent monitoring**: Continues across restarts without external schedulers
- **Efficient resource usage**: No compute costs during delay periods on serverless
- **Flexible intervals**: Easily adjust monitoring frequency based on business needs
