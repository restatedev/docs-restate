## Durable Agents and Workflows

Restate automatically handles the reliability challenges of AI agents:

<img src="/img/usecases/agents/durable-execution-animation-agents.gif" alt="Durable AI Agent Execution" />

- **Automatically retry transient errors** like rate limits and network failures
- **Persist steps** (LLM calls, tools) and recover previous progress after failures  
- **Suspend long-running agents** when idle to save costs

## Plugs into Popular SDKs

Restate works independently of any SDK and specific AI stack, but its lightweight programming abstraction integrates easily into many popular SDKs. A few lines turn your agent into a durable agent.

```typescript {"CODE_LOAD::ts/src/usecases/agents/weather-agent.ts#here"} 
const model = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  middleware: durableCalls(restateContext, { maxRetryAttempts: 3 }),
});
```

Works with [Vercel AI SDK](/ai/sdk-integrations/vercel-ai-sdk), [OpenAI](/ai/sdk-integrations/openai-agents-sdk), and [others](/ai#llm-&-agent-sdk-integrations).

## Human-in-the-Loop and Workflow Patterns

Restate's workflows-as-code and building blocks make it easy to reliably implement:

## Observability and Debugging

See all ongoing executions with detailed journals of agent steps:

</Frame>

- **Complete execution timeline**: Every LLM call and tool execution
- **Debug failed agents**: Inspect exactly where and why agents failed
- **Agent control**: Pause, resume, restart agents during development and production

## End-to-End Resilient Applications

Agents are just a part of your application. Restate covers the plumbing around your agents:

</Frame>
- **Queuing, state, session management**: Built-in primitives for reliable agent coordination
- **Deterministic workflows**: Complement agents with structured business logic  
- **Reliable asynchronous tasks**: Handle background work and inter-service communication

## Flexible Deployments and Scalability

Restate's durable execution runtime lets you run your durable code where you want at the scale you want:
<img src="/img/usecases/agents/ai-app-layout.png" alt="Application Structure"/>

- **Scale to millions** of concurrent agent executions
- **Deploy your agents** on FaaS or containers
- **You own the infrastructure**: Run on Restate Cloud or self-host
