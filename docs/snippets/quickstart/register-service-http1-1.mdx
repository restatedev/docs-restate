Tell Restate where the service is running, so Restate can discover and register the services and handlers behind this endpoint.
You can do this via the UI (`http://localhost:9070`) or via:

<CodeGroup>
```shell CLI
restate deployments register http://localhost:9080 --use-http1.1
```
```shell curl
curl localhost:9070/deployments --json '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080", "use_http_11": true}'
```
</CodeGroup>
Expected output:
<CodeGroup>
```shell CLI
❯ SERVICES THAT WILL BE ADDED:
- Greeter
Type: Service
HANDLER  INPUT                                     OUTPUT
greet    value of content-type 'application/json'  value of content-type 'application/json'


✔ Are you sure you want to apply those changes? · yes
✅ DEPLOYMENT:
SERVICE  REV

```

```shell curl
{
"id": "dp_17sztQp4gnEC1L0OCFM9aEh",
    "services": [
        {
            "name": "Greeter",
            "handlers": [
                {
                    "name": "greet",
                    "ty": "Shared",
                    "input_description": "one of [\"none\", \"value of content-type 'application/json'\"]",
                    "output_description": "value of content-type 'application/json'"
                }
            ],
            "ty": "Service",
            "deployment_id": "dp_17sztQp4gnEC1L0OCFM9aEh",
            "revision": 1,
            "public": true,
            "idempotency_retention": "1day"
        }
    ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

{runtime} does not support HTTP2, so we need to tell Restate to use HTTP1.1.

If you run Restate with Docker, use `http://host.docker.internal:9080` instead of `http://localhost:9080`.

<Info title="Restate Cloud">
    When using [Restate Cloud](https://restate.dev/cloud), your service must be accessible over the public internet so Restate can invoke it.
    If you want to develop with a local service, you can expose it using our [tunnel](/deploy/server/cloud/#registering-restate-services-with-your-environment) feature.
