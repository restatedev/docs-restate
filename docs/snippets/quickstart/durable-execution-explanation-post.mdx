You can see in the service logs and in the Restate UI how the request gets retried.
On a retry, it skipped the steps that already succeeded.

Even the sleep is durable and tracked by Restate.
If you kill/restart the service halfway through, the sleep will only last for what remained.

<Tip title={"Durable Execution"}>
    Restate persists the progress of the handler.
    Letting you write code that is resilient to failures out of the box.
    Have a look at the [Durable Execution page](/foundations/key-concepts#durable-execution) to learn more.
