Send a request for `Alice` to see how the service behaves when it occasionally fails to send the reminder and notification:
```shell
curl localhost:8080/Greeter/greet --json '{"name": "Alice"}'
```
Expected output:
```shell
You said hi to Alice!
```

You can see in the service logs and in the Restate UI how the request gets retried.
On a retry, it skipped the steps that already succeeded.

Even the sleep is durable and tracked by Restate.
If you kill/restart the service halfway through, the sleep will only last for what remained.

<Tip title={"Durable Execution"}>
    Restate persists the progress of the handler.
    Letting you write code that is resilient to failures out of the box.
    Have a look at the [Durable Execution page](/concepts/durable_execution) to learn more.
