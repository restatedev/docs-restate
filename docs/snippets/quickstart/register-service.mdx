Tell Restate where the service is running, so Restate can discover and register the services and handlers behind this endpoint.
You can do this via the UI (`http://localhost:9070`) or via:

<CodeGroup>
```shell CLI
restate deployments register http://localhost:9080
```
```shell curl
curl localhost:9070/deployments --json '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
```
</CodeGroup>

If you run Restate with Docker, register `http://host.docker.internal:9080` instead of `http://localhost:9080`.

<Accordion title="Restate Cloud">
    When using [Restate Cloud](https://restate.dev/cloud), your service must be accessible over the public internet so Restate can invoke it.
    If you want to develop with a local service, you can expose it using our [tunnel](/deploy/server/cloud/#registering-restate-services-with-your-environment) feature.
