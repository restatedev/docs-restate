AI agents make multiple LLM calls and tool executions that can fail due to rate limits, network issues, or service outages.
Restate uses Durable Execution to make your agents withstand failures without losing progress.

The Restate SDK records the steps the agent executes in a log and replays them if the process crashes or is restarted:

Durable Execution is the basis of how Restate makes your agents resilient to failures.
Restate offers durable execution primitives via its SDK.
