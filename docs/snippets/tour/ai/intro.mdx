AI agents are long-running processes that combine LLMs with tools and external APIs to complete complex tasks. With Restate, you can build agents that are **resilient to failures**, **stateful across conversations**, and **observable** without managing complex retry logic or external state stores.

In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Build durable AI agents that recover automatically from crashes and API failures
- Integrate Restate with the {agentsdk}
- Observe and debug agent executions with detailed traces
- Implement resilient human-in-the-loop workflows with approvals and timeouts
- Manage conversation history and state across multi-turn interactions
- Orchestrate multiple agents working together on complex tasks

## Getting Started

A Restate AI application has two main components:
- **Restate Server**: The core engine that takes care of the orchestration and resiliency of your agents
- **Agent Services**: Your agent or AI workflow logic using the Restate SDK for durability

Restate works with how you already deploy your agents, whether that's in Docker, on Kubernetes, or via serverless platforms (Modal, AWS Lambda...). You don't need to run your agents in any special way.

Let's run an example locally to get a better feel for how it works.
