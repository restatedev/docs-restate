## When to use concurrent tasks

Use concurrent tasks when you need to:
- Call multiple external services simultaneously (e.g., fetching data from different APIs)
- Race multiple operations and use the first result (e.g., trying multiple LLM providers)
- Implement timeouts by racing an operation against a timer
- Perform batch operations where individual tasks can run in parallel

## Key benefits

- **Deterministic replay**: Restate logs the order of completion, ensuring consistent behavior during failures
- **Fault tolerance**: If your handler fails, concurrent operations resume from where they left off
- **Flexible patterns**: Wait for all, any, or the first N tasks to complete
