When building resilient applications, you often need to perform multiple operations in parallel to improve performance and user experience. Restate provides durable concurrency primitives that allow you to run tasks concurrently while maintaining deterministic execution during replays.

## When to use concurrent tasks

Use concurrent tasks when you need to:
- Call multiple external services simultaneously (e.g., fetching data from different APIs)
- Race multiple operations and use the first result (e.g., trying multiple LLM providers)
- Implement timeouts by racing an operation against a timer
- Perform batch operations where individual tasks can run in parallel

## Key benefits

- **Deterministic replay**: Restate logs the order of completion, ensuring consistent behavior during failures
- **Fault tolerance**: If your handler fails, tasks that were already completed will be replayed with their results, while pending tasks will be retried
