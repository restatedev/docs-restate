### Two signaling patterns

**External → Workflow** (shown above): External handlers signal the run handler
- Use for human approvals, external API responses, manual interventions
- External handlers call the handler which resolves the promise

**Workflow → External**: Run handler signals other handlers waiting for workflow events
- Use for step completion notifications, status updates, result broadcasting
- Run handler resolves promises that external handlers are awaiting

## Best Practices

- **Use awakeables** for services/objects coordinating with external systems
- **Use durable promises** for workflow signaling
- **Always handle rejections** to gracefully manage failures
- **Include timeouts** for long-running external processes
