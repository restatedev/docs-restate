Restate provides durable, fault-tolerant timers that allow you to:
- [Sleep](#durable-sleep): Pause a handler for a given duration
- [Send delayed messages](#delayed-messages): Schedule handler invocations in the future
- [Set timeouts](#timers-and-timeouts) for async operations
- Implement patterns like [cron jobs](#cron-jobs)

## How it works

Restate tracks and manages timers, ensuring they survive failures and restarts.
For example, if a service is sleeping for 12 hours and fails after 8 hours, then Restate will make sure it only sleeps 4 hours more.

If your handler runs on function-as-a-service platforms like AWS Lambda, Restate suspends the handler while it is sleeping, to free up resources.
Since these platforms charge on execution time, this saves costs.
