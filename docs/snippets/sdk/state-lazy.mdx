## Advanced: Eager vs. lazy state loading

Restate supports two modes for loading state in handlers:

### Eager state (default)
- **How it works**: State is automatically sent with the request when invoking a handler
- **Benefits**: State is available immediately when the handler starts executing
- **Behavior**: All reads and writes to state are local to the handler execution
- **Best for**: Small to medium state objects that are frequently accessed

### Lazy state
- **How it works**: State is fetched on-demand on `get` calls from the Restate Server
- **Benefits**: Reduces initial request size and memory usage
- **Setup**: Enable lazy state in the [service or handler configuration](/services/configuration)
- **Best for**: Large state objects that aren't needed in every handler execution
