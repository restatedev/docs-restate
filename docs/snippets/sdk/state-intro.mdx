Restate lets you persist key-value (K/V) state using its embedded K/V store.

## Key characteristics

</Info>

**State is only available for Virtual Objects and Workflows.**

Scope & retention:
- For Virtual Objects: State is scoped per object key and retained indefinitely. It is persisted and shared across all invocations for that object until explicitly cleared.
- For Workflows: State is scoped per workflow execution (workflow ID) and retained only for the duration of the workflowâ€™s configured retention time.

Access Rules:
- [Exclusive handlers](/foundations/functions#handler-behavior) (e.g., `run()` in workflows) can read and write state.
- [Shared handlers](/foundations/functions#handler-behavior) can only read state and cannot mutate it.

You can inspect and edit the K/V state via the UI and the [CLI](/services/introspection#inspecting-application-state).
